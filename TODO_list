Things we need to do:

1) make sure model input and output files are deleted prior to runs

2) handling weights?

3) for example model, looks like too poorly constrained. Sensitive to initial
   values. Perhaps we should make the "true" field more heterogeneous and also
   be sure the well is sufficiently stressing or maybe add recharge.

4) clean up the "not currently being used" variables
