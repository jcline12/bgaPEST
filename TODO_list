Things we need to do:

1) make sure model input and output files are deleted prior to runs

2) handling weights?

3) for example model, looks like too poorly constrained. Sensitive to initial
   values. Perhaps we should make the "true" field more heterogeneous and also
   be sure the well is sufficiently stressing or maybe add recharge.

4) clean up the "not currently being used" variables

5) could use some memory management. For example, deallocate Jacobian before calling PEST

6) handle all the output that is not yet dealt with in the progress of the algorithm.

7) see that the mean is being properly used - looks maybe like perturbations are going on the prior mean rather than the estimated mean!!
