Things we need to do:

1)***DONE*** make sure model input and output files are deleted prior to runs

2) handling weights?

3) ***DONE*** see (7) below. ***ALSO made a "new true" model with more heterog and uneven BC elevs***
    For example model, looks like too poorly constrained. Sensitive to initial
   values. Perhaps we should make the "true" field more heterogeneous and also
   be sure the well is sufficiently stressing or maybe add recharge.

4) clean up the "not currently being used" variables

5) could use some memory management. For example, deallocate Jacobian before calling PEST

6) handle all the output that is not yet dealt with in the progress of the algorithm.
       Specifically need to output REC file (bpr), progressive output from linesearch,
       and objective function history.

7) ***DONE*** --> hangup was with linesearch. see that the mean is being properly used - looks
    maybe like perturbations are going on the prior mean rather than the estimated mean!!

8) ***DONE*** Need to add noise to the observations in the test problem.

9) Structural parameter optimization.

9a) a critical step within structural parameter optimization will be parsing the actual theta and sigma values
   that are to be optimized. The problem being, Nelder-Mead (at least as implemented in fminsearch in MATLAB) expects
   a single vector of variables to optimize. We need the flexibility to only optimize one or the other, however. This
   is an ongoing item of work and may be resolved in the documentation of the Nelder-Mead implementation, but on a 
   plane now so not amenable to searching at the moment!

9b) It looks like the function arguments for NELMIN beyond the main vector of theta are hard-coded, so we
    will need to write alternative versions of NELMIN - one for the linesearch and one for structural parameters.

10) Need to test PEST sensitivities against ADJOINT. Previous work made me suspect that there was
    a discrepancy, but I don't reall if this is true or not.
