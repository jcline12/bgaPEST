Response to Steve Westenbroek Colleague Review of

Approaches in Highly Parameterized Inversion – bgaPEST: A Bayesian Geostatistica

Dear Steve:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thanks very much for your review of our manuscript 
\emph on
Approaches in Highly Parameterized Inversion – bgaPEST: A Bayesian Geostatistica
l Approach Implementation with Pest – Documentation and Instructions.
 
\emph default
You provided valuable insights that will certainly improve the use and readabili
ty of the documentation.
 In the remainder of this document I have repeated your comments either
 in plain type or as a pasted graphic and responded in 
\emph on
italics
\emph default
 indicating my response and action taken.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the first section, I repeat and discuss the general comments made in
 your email message.
 In the second, I discuss your annotations in the PDF.
 In several cases, very obvious typographical errors (errant spaces, etc.)
 were noted.
 Unless specifically repeated here, you may assume that such minor changes
 were made.

General Comments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dear Mike,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have reviewed your bgaPEST documentation and have made numerous comments
 and suggestions in the attached annotated PDF document.
 Feel free to use the suggestions and comments as you see fit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I discussed with you some time back, I have not reviewed the mathematics
 contained in the document.
 Also, I have not yet had the opportunity to fire up the executable, although
 I hope to change that in the near future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I think the document is well-written for a specialized professional (academic?)
 target audience.
 The document assumes knowledge and mastery of many high-level mathematical
 concepts, and will only make sense to a person already making use of PEST
 or UCODE(?!) software in model optimization exercises.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, try as I might, I still do not have a solid conceptual (intuitive
) understanding of what goes on inside the software.
 As I indicated in my attached comments, the flow chart within the current
 document presents a view of the process that is perhaps too streamlined.
 I think that it is important to attempt to communicate (conceptually) the
 steps involved in the outer and inner loops so that the control variables
 within bgaPEST may be modified intelligently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please talk to me if any of my comments or suggestions is unclear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cheers,
