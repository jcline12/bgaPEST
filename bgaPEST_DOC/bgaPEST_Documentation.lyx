Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Environmental modeling serves many purposes for managing natural resources.
 In most cases, models are made to represent physical processes such as
 groundwater flow, contaminant transport, surface water flood routing, and
 others.
 The challenge to simulate the governing equations and concepts such as
 conservation of mass and momentum is only part of the challenge.
 Once a model adequately represents the physical characteristics of the
 problem, it is still a general tool until it is calibrated to observations
 at the specific site to be managed.
 Parameter estimation and calibration are both terms describing the process
 of incorporating the site-specific information into a model making it suitable
 to be applied to management decisions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This concept is so important that one may interpret a model as a data-processing
 tool as much as a simulator of physical processes; the data processing
 being a pipeline from field observation to model parameters and ultimately
 to predictions.
 Another interpretation is a Bayesian one in which the model is a vehicle
 for updating an 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
 understanding of the system to a conditional, 
\emph on
a posteriori
\emph default
 understanding.
 This is the approach adopted in this work and will be discussed in more
 detail.
 First, however, the concept of conditionality must be emphasized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bayes' theorem is at the heart of the techniques in this Report:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p\left(\mathbf{s}|\mathbf{y}\right)\propto L\left(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{s}\right)p\left(\mathbf{s}\right)\label{eq:bayes1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

 is a vector of parameter values, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 is a vector of observations, 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(\cdot\right)$
\end_inset

 indicates a probability density function (pdf), 
\begin_inset Formula $L\left(\cdot\right)$
\end_inset

 indicates a likelihood function, and 
\begin_inset Formula $|$
\end_inset

 indicates conditionality.
 In words, Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of parameters
 conditional on the observations 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(\mathbf{s}|\mathbf{y}\right)$
\end_inset

, is proportional to the prior probability of the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(\mathbf{s}\right)$
\end_inset

 updated with the likelihood function 
\begin_inset Formula $L\left(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{s}\right)$
\end_inset

 that expresses how well 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 is estimated using the model and a candidate parameter set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

.
 The pdfs in all cases are assumed to follow Gaussian distributions.
 This assumption is important and somewhat restrictive, but it is made for
 reasons of computational simplicity.
 Active research is ongoing on alternatives to this approach, but the Gaussian
 assumption is adopted in this report.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Bayesian context, by expressing the parameters and the likelihood
 function as probability distributions, they formally incorporate an estimate
 of their uncertainty rather than being treated as perfectly known values.
 All 
\emph on
a posteriori 
\emph default
(also called posterior) distributions are conditional upon the specific
 data used in the calibration process.
 Implicitly, they are also conditional on all other modeling and data decisions
 that go into formulating the problem: which model and what model options
 are chosen, numerical considerations such as discretization and solver
 convergence criteria, boundary conditions that may or may not be considered
 static and known, variance values and weights given to individual observations
 and parameters, and others.
 The point is, if any of these things change, it is expected, in the Bayesian
 context, that the parameters estimated will also change.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As discussed in the previous paragraph, the conditionality includes 
\emph on
all 
\emph default
decisions made in the process of constructing a model and incorporating
 data.
 Not all of this information is explicit, however.
 In fact, the only 
\emph on
explicit 
\emph default
conditionality is on the data.
 The information contained in the prior pdf (
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(\mathbf{s}\right)$
\end_inset

) in eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:bayes1"

\end_inset

 is critical as well because this represents the state of knowledge about
 the parameters in the system prior to updating through the calibration
 process.
 In this Report, the assumptions made prior to calibration are limited to
 the assignment of a mean value (unknown) of each distinct parameter type
 and region within the model domain (beta association--described below),
 and a characteristic about continuity or smoothness of the parameter field.
 The degree to which this characteristic is enforced is dictated by the
 observations and the subsequent performance of the model.
 This is very similar (and in some cases, mathematically equivalent) to
 Tikhonov regularization.
 Limiting the information assumed 
\emph on
a priori 
\emph default
is similar to assuming an ignorance prior (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
after "chapter 12"
key "jaynesBook"

\end_inset

) such that the driver of the problem is more the observations than prior
 assumptions.
 Additionally, so-called structural parameters that enforce the characteristic
 are estimated using restricted maximum likelihood.
 All of these aspects of the algorithm, taken together, may be considered
 an Empirical Bayes approach.

, 
\begin_inset Formula $L\text{\left(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{s}\right)}$
\end_inset

, expresses the correspondence of model outcomes with field observations
 collocated in space and time.
 This correspondence is expressed as the sum of the squared differences
 between outcomes and observations, weighted by a covariance matrix.
 This is effectively equivalent to the weighted measurement objective function
 in PEST

\begin_layout Section*
Purpose and Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This Report is intended to serve two main purposes.
 First, a Bayesian approach to parameter estimation--expressed in the context
 of the Bayesian Geostatistical Approach (BGA)--is introduced to provide
 a framework for moving a model from a general simulator of a physical process
 to a specific tool, based on a set of calibration information, that can
 be used for management of a particular site and issue.
 Second, a computer code--bgaPEST--is introduced and documented in which
 BGA is deployed in a framework based on the free and open-source PEST suite
 of software 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "PEST"

\end_inset

.
 The input framework is consistent with the JUPITER project 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "BantaEtAl2006"

\end_inset

.
 This marks the first implementation of BGA available for general use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This initial implementation is written in FORTRAN-90 with limited capabilities
 in Python.
 For users on the Windows operating system, installation of Python is optional
 as the Python codes are compiled into executables using py2exe that can
 be called by the main program.
 For users on Macintosh or Linux systems, all the code must be compiled
 for the native platform and Python should already be installed so the Python
 scripts may be called directly without need to compile them separately.
 The use of external derivatives calculation with PEST and Python will be
 replaced by integration of a general parallel run management suite (GENIE)
 in the near future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part of the approach, as discussed in this Report, is based on a distributed
 parameterization scheme meant to be flexible in that in certain regions
 of the model (called beta associations) a unique parameter value is estimated
 for each model node or cell.
 This leads to a large number of parameters which is accompanied by computationa
l challenges.
 Some of these challenges can be alleviated by restricting beta associations
 in which distributed parameterization schema are implemented to have constant
 spacing in both lateral directions and must have consistent layer thickness.
 These three values need only be constant in their respective dimensions
 but they may differ from dimension to dimension.
 This restriction allows for implementation of a Toeplitz compression making
 it possible to use many more parameters than would otherwise be possible.
 The partitioning into beta associations makes it easy to combine distributed
 parameters in areas of most interest and where data are more available,
 and homogeneous zones in areas surrounding the main focus.
 The use of a Toeplitz compression is optional and, in cases where sufficient
 computational resources allow it, compression may be skipped and the restrictio
ns on even spacing are not invoked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of this Report provides some details on the mathematical theory
 behind BGA, followed by detailed instructions for using the computer program.
 Conventions and assumptions for using the program are included in the discussio
n.

Bayesian Geostatistical Approach Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Bayesian geostatistical approach is described in detail in

key "KitanidisVomvoris1983,HoeksemaKitanidis1984a,Kitanidis1995,NowakCirpka2004"

\end_inset

 among others.
 In this Section, we provide an overview of the method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The core of the Bayesian geostatistical inverse method is Bayes' theorem,
 which states
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p(\mathbf{s|y})\propto L(\mathbf{y|s})p(\mathbf{s})\label{eq:bayes}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$

\series default
 are the measured data, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

 are the unknown parameters, 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\mathbf{s|y})$
\end_inset

 is the posterior probability density function (pdf) of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

 given 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\mathbf{y|s})$
\end_inset

 is the likelihood function, and 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\mathbf{s})$
\end_inset

 is the prior pdf of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

.
 Details of these pdfs are explained below.

\end_inset

 depicts one-dimensional distributions graphically illustrating Equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:bayes"

\end_inset

.
 In this example, the prior distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p\left(\mathbf{s}\right)\right)$
\end_inset

 is diffuse, meaning the variance is relatively high and, correspondingly,
 commitment to a particular value is low.
 The likelihood function 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(L\left(\mathbf{y|s}\right)\right)$
\end_inset

, on the other hand, has lower variance, suggesting a process that brings
 a higher level of certainty to the estimation of the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{s}\right)$
\end_inset

 than is indicated by the prior distribution only.
 The resulting posterior distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p\left(\mathbf{s|y}\right)\right)$
\end_inset

 is a convolution of the prior and likelihood functions.
 The peak is shifted significantly from the prior toward the likelihood
 and is higher.
 The posterior distribution also has lower variance than the prior as illustrate
d by the spread in the figure.
 Since the likelihood function is more focused (less spread) and higher
 than the prior, the attributes of the likelihood contribute more to the
 posterior than the prior does.

 In general terms, the likelihood function

 characterizes the misfit between model forecasts and observations while
 the prior pdf

 to apply to the parameter field.

which is the superposition of the prior mean (first term) and an innovation
 term which considers deviations of the predictions from the observations
 (second term).
 In this context, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 in the first term is not the prior mean, but is the best estimate of the
 mean (mapped onto the parameter field through the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}$
\end_inset

 matrix) while the second term is fluctuations about the estimated mean.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{H}$
\end_inset

 in the second term (often referred to as the Jacobian, sensitivity, or
 susceptibility matrix) is the sensitivity of observation values to parameter
 values 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{where }H_{ij}=\frac{\partial\mathbf{h}\left(\mathbf{s}\right)_{i}}{\partial\mathbf{s}_{j}}$
\end_inset

, which can be calculated using either finite difference or adjoint-state
 methods.
 In bgaPEST, finite-difference calculations for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{H}$
\end_inset

 are calculated using PEST whereas adjoint-state calculations depend on
 the specific model being used and must be calculated using an external
 program.

 is the auto-covariance matrix of the observations, defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{HQ_{ss}H^{\mathbf{T}}+R}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

\begin_layout Standard
In hydrogeologic applications, the numerical forward model is typically
 nonlinear.
 Further nonlinearity can be induced by using a logarithmic transformation,
 which is a convenient way to enforce non-negativity on parameters and is
 often an appropriate transformation for hydraulic conductivity parameters
 in groundwater models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Provided that the nonlinearities introduced are not too extreme, a solution
 can be obtained through successive linearizations following the quasi-linear
 extension 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The forward model, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{h(s)}$
\end_inset

 is expanded about the current best estimate of the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\tilde{s}}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{h}(\mathbf{s})\mathbf{\approx h}(\mathbf{\tilde{s}})\mathbf{+\tilde{H}}(\mathbf{s-\tilde{s}})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\tilde{H}}$
\end_inset

, as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\tilde{s,}}$
\end_inset

 is evaluated at each linearization.
 We assign the subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $_{k}$
\end_inset

 to indicate iteration number, and correct the measurements for the 
\begin_inset Formula $k^{th}$
\end_inset

 linearization as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{y}_{k}^{'}=\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{h}(\tilde{\mathbf{s}}_{k})+\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{k}\tilde{\mathbf{s}}_{k}.
\]

\end_inset

Then the cokriging equations (Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:cokriging-1"

\end_inset

) are updated
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\tilde{\mathbf{Q}}_{\mathbf{yy},k} & \tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{k}\mathbf{X}\\
\mathbf{X}^{T}\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{k}^{T} & \mathbf{-}\mathbf{Q_{\beta\beta}^{-1}}
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\mathbf{\xi}_{k}\\
\hat{\mathbf{\beta}}_{k}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\mathbf{y}_{k}^{'}\\
\mathbf{-}\mathbf{Q_{\beta\beta}^{-1}}\beta^{*}
\end{array}\right]\label{eq:iterations-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{Q}}_{\mathbf{yy},k}=\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{k}\mathbf{Q_{ss}}\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{k}^{T}+\mathbf{R}$
\end_inset

 .
 From this set of equations, the next estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{\mathbf{s}}_{k+1}=\mathbf{X\hat{\beta}}_{k}+\mathbf{Q_{ss}}\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{k}^{T}\mathbf{\xi}_{k}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This can be iterated until there is no difference in the parameter estimates,
 or when there is no further improvement in the objective function.
 The objective function, which we seek to minimize, is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{-}\ln p\left(\mathbf{s|y}\right)$
\end_inset

 which is equivalent to maximizing Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:BGA"

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{L}=\mathbf{-}\ln p\left(\mathbf{s|y}\right)=(\mathbf{s-X\beta}^{*})^{T}\mathbf{G_{\mathbf{ss}}^{-1}}(\mathbf{s-X\beta^{*}})+\left(\mathbf{y-h}(\mathbf{s})\right)^{T}\mathbf{R^{-1}\left(\mathbf{y-h}(\mathbf{s})\right)}
\]

\end_inset

In many cases, numerical instability makes convergence difficult.
 A line search is implemented in which a linear search is performed between
 the most recent best estimate of the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{\hat{s}}\right)$
\end_inset

 and the current linearization of the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{\widetilde{\mathbf{s}}}\right)$
\end_inset

, seeking a parameter value that minimizes an objective function.
 
\end_layout

An extension to this approach is the inclusion of information about the

 The mean is estimated in the solution, but a prior value and covariance
 can be supplied to constrain the estimate.
 Typically, a relatively high covariance magnitude is used so the information
 about the mean is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

diffuse

 and principally serves the role of providing numerical stability rather
 than compelling the solution to adhere closely to prior values.

\begin_layout Standard
The forward model is constructed to provide outputs of values collocated
 in space and time with the measured observations.
 The likelihood function brings the observed data into the calculation by
 quantifying the difference (misfit) between the model forecasts and collocated
 observations.
 In all modeling, we must acknowledge that perfect correspondence between
 forecasts and observations is neither attainable nor desirable.
 The observations themselves are corrupted by measurement errors and there
 is usually a lack of perfect correspondence between the exact nature of
 the measurements and the simulated counterparts.
 This corruption is due to uncertainty from sources including the paucity
 of observations, imperfections in the conceptual model, and approximations
 made to codify the physics of the phenomena into a numerical model framework.
 All of these sources of uncertainty are described by the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

epistemic uncertainty
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "p. 4"

\end_inset

.
 This epistemic uncertainty characterizes the expected misfit between forecasts
 and observations, and is expressed through a covariance function.
 As a result, the likelihood function can be characterized by a Gaussian
 distribution with zero mean and covariance defined by the epistemic uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With both the prior pdf and likelihood function expressed as Gaussian distributi
ons, the posterior pdf (discussed below) is also Gaussian.
 The values of the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

 that result in the maximum value of the posterior pdf are therefore the
 most likely solution on a point-by-point basis.
 The solution as a whole is always a somewhat smoothed version of reality,
 but the small-scale variability can be characterized through conditional
 realizations.
 The balance between the strength of smoothing and the closeness of corresponden
ce between forecasts and observations is found through calculation of optimal
 values for the structural parameters, including a value to quantify the
 epistemic uncertainty.

\begin_layout Standard
In an idealized problem, a single covariance model is flexible enough to
 encompass the entire variability of the hydraulic parameters.
 However, in many hydrogeologic applications, lithologic contacts and unconformi
ties can create discontinuities in parameter values that a single covariance
 model cannot characterize.
 Partitioning the field based on either the data 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 or through interrogation of preliminary solutions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "FienenWRR2008"

\end_inset

 can greatly improve results.
 This partitioning is implemented by imposing discontinuities in the stochastic
 field that censor correlation among all cells that do not occur in the
 same partition.
 In this context, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stochastic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 refers to the entity being partitioned (namely the correlation structure
 of the parameter field) but we emphasize here that the locations of the
 imposed discontinuities are themselves considered deterministic and certain.
 This partitioning is consistent with zonal boundaries in models made up
 of homogeneous zones.
 Furthermore, multiple types of parameters (for example, hydraulic conductivity
 and recharge) may be estimated.
 Similar censoring of correlation among different types of parameters is
 also necessary in most applications through partitioning.

For hydrogeologic applications, we adopted the term

 from the facies architecture field to describe these partitions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

 The term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

facies association

 typically refers to descriptive properties of a subset of a medium in the

\begin_inset Quotes eld

 is used in the broader case where the characteristics are more formally
 defined, (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

).
 It is appropriate to use the less restrictive and less transferable term
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

facies association
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in this work because when we subdivide the correlation structure of the
 medium, we often base the stochastic discontinuities (bounding surfaces,
 or contacts) on perceived hydraulic properties.
 These properties will often coincide with differences in age, provenance,
 or depositional environment, but such coincidence is not required for or
 by their use.
 In all cases, partitioning into facies associations must be based on readily
 observable hydrologic or lithologic attributes.

 As shown in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, the Greek letter 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

 stands for the mean of a region of distributed parameters.
 Beta associations can, therefore, delineate regions of a distributed parameter
 field that have similar statistical properties and correspond to the same
 mean value.
 However, importantly, beta associations can also refer to completely different
 parameter types (for example, hydraulic conductivity and recharge).

To clarify our terminology in this work, partitions delineated by stochastic

\begin_inset Quotes eld

 The beta associations delineate sub-regions of the model domain that share
 correlation characteristics and are uncorrelated from neighboring beta
 associations; they are usually delineated by features that are easily identifie

 In beta associations, variability of parameter values within each cell
 is allowed and constrained by the

 value represents the property for the entire zone.
 Beta associations also delineate regions in the model (whether defined

 This term was used in place of

 Beta associations are

 bgaPEST allows the definition of anisotropy in a horizontal plane at any
 angle from the x-axis and also in the vertical direction.
 The general layout of horizontal anisotropy is illustrated in Figure

Prior Covariance Matrix Storage Issues
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In underdetermined problems suitable for bgaPEST, the number of parameters
 can be very large.
 The prior covariance matrix discussed above can, therefore, grow to such
 large dimensions that it cannot be practically stored in computer memory.
 However, two techniques are provided to alleviate some of this storage
 stress: compression and Toeplitz transformation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compression takes advantage of the fact that values in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{G_{ss}}$
\end_inset

 matrix relating parameters in different beta associations, by definition,
 have the value of zero.
 As a result, a general 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{G_{ss}}$
\end_inset

 matrix can be viewed as a partitioned matrix of nonzero blocks 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{ss},\beta i}\right)$
\end_inset

 and zero blocks
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{ss}}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{ss},\beta1} & \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0}\\
\mathbf{0} & \mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{ss},\beta2} & \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0}\\
\mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & \ddots & \mathbf{0}\\
\mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{ss},\beta p}
\end{array}\right].
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is no need to store the zero elements provided that accommodations
 are made to avoid multiplications that involve the zeros.
 These accommodations have been made in bgaPEST and compression is, therefore,
 allowed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In cases where spacial spacing is constant in respective directions, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{ss},\beta i}$
\end_inset

 is a Toeplitz matrix

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This matrix has the properties that there are only 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 unique values, and these values occur in a regular order such that only
 a vector of length 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 needs to be stored from which individual rows can be constructed to perform
 matrix multiplication operations.
 The spacing, as indicated above, must be constant.
 For example, in a spatial model such as properties in a groundwater model,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x,$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta y,$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta z$
\end_inset

 must be constant, but these values do not need to be equal to each other.
 While this is restrictive in the sense that it implies a regular grid that
 may not correspond to geometry in the field.
 However, the regular grid required to take advantage of Toeplitz storage
 and operations can be assigned to one beta association with a surrounding,
 irregular grid put in another beta association with fewer parameter values.

 The first level corresponds to the model layers, the second level corresponds

 in the first (leftmost) column.
 Cycling of rows or columns, relative to the single stored vector, can be
 used to reconstruct any row or column of the main matrix to be used in
 multiplication operations.

Implementation of Partitions into Beta Associations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concept of beta associations is discussed above and details of their
 implementation are explained here.
 First, the prior covariance matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Q_{ss}}$
\end_inset

 is censored by assigning a value of zero to each element which characterizes
 covariance between cells of different regions or parameter types, as defined
 by beta associations.
 It is not required that the covariance model be the same for each beta
 association.
 If different covariance models are used for different zones, this is reflected
 in the appropriate parts of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Q_{ss}}.$
\end_inset

 Furthermore, in some applications, a single structural parameter, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta,$
\end_inset

 may be estimated and applied to all of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Q_{ss}.}$
\end_inset

 In other cases, and necessarily if the covariance model differs in various
 beta association, multiple elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\theta}$
\end_inset

 are estimated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A distinct prior mean parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\beta^{*}}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}$
\end_inset

 (Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) is determined as explained in above.
 In cases where the mean of each zone is completely unknown, no values for
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\beta^{*}}$

 are provided, but the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}$

Structural Parameters and Restricted Maximum Likelihood
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A vital element to the method outlined above is proper selection of the
 structural parameters.
 Structural parameters--also called hyperparameters--or nuisance parameters,
 are the parameters that characterize the covariance structure of both the
 epistemic uncertainty related to the observations, and the inherent variability
 of the parameters.
 In this work, structural parameters may include the epistemic uncertainty
 term in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Outer iterations (also called bga iterations) are wrapped around the entire
 parameter estimation process with the exception of calculating posterior
 covariance.
 Inner iterations are performed to account for the restricted maximum likelihood
 estimation of structural parameters.
 If structural parameters are not chosen to be estimated, then a single
 outer iteration is performed using the initial values of structural parameters
 and inner iterations are performed until convergence or until the number
 of iterations reaches

 If a linesearch is requested, this is performed within the inner iterations.
 If structural parameter optimization is requested, it is performed after
 convergence or maximum inner iterations are reached.
 Then, restricted maximum likelihood is performed to estimate a new set
 of structural parameters.
 The interdependence between structural parameters and model parameters
 requires reiteration of the inner iterations and structural parameter estimatio
n until both have converged or the maximum number of outer iterations has
 been reached.

 Control variables, on the other hand, are in a sense abstracted one level
 from data and are meta-parameters that impact either the reading/writing
 of data or control the progression of the algorithm.
 Many control variables are straightforward (for example, 
\family typewriter
beta_cov_form
\family default
\emph on
, 
\emph default
an integer, is the form of the prior mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\beta\right)$
\end_inset

 covariance matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{Q}_{\beta\beta}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 [0] = none, [1] = diagonal, [2] = full matrix.
 
\emph on
default = 0).

\emph default
 Such variables are defined in the context of the input instructions in
 Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Input-Instructions"

\end_inset

.
 However, other control variables are accompanied by important conventions
 regarding their impact on the performance of the algorithm.
 For these cases, in this section, more detail is provided about certain
 control variables.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Output Files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several output files are generated throughout the progression of a single
 bgaPEST run.
 These files are summarized in this section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
bgaPEST Record File 
\family typewriter
<casename>.bpr
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main output file for bgaPEST is called 
\family typewriter
<casename>.bpr
\family default
.
 Initial values of bgaPEST input are repeated to form a record for the bgaPEST
 run.
 After each inner iteration, as defined above, the objective function is
 reported and external files are written that include current parameter
 values and observation values.
 After each outer iteration, structural parameter values are also reported
 for each beta association in which structural parameter estimation was
 requested and for the epistemic uncertainty term, if requested.
 After the final outer iteration, all structural parameter values--including
 those which were not estimated--are reported to make a complete record.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
bgaPEST Parameter Value Files 
\family typewriter
<casename>.bpp.<#Oi>_<#Ii>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The parameter values are written to files called 
\family typewriter
<casename>.bpp.<#Oi>_<#Ii> 
\family default
where
\family typewriter
 <#Oi> 
\family default
is the outer iteration number and
\family typewriter
 <#Ii> 
\family default
is the inner iteration number.
 These ascii files are printed in columns with the following headers: 
\family typewriter
ParamName
\family default
; 
\family typewriter
ParamGroup
\family default
; 
\family typewriter
BetaAssoc
\family default
; 
\family typewriter
ParamVal
\family default
.
 At the beginning of a bgaPEST run, a file 
\family typewriter
<casename>.bpp.0 
\family default
is written in the same format to record the initial parameter values used.
 This is done to avoid cluttering the 
\family typewriter
<casename>.bpr
\family default
 file with what is often a very long list of parameters and their values.
 Parameter values that were subjected to logarithmic transformation are
 reported in their linear space, 
\emph on
not 
\emph default
log-transformed space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another special case of parameter value files is written at the end of a
 bgaPEST run and called 
\family typewriter
<casename>.bpp.fin
\family default
.
 This file contains the final parameter values estimated as optimal by bgaPEST.
 Furthermore, if posterior covariance calculation was requested, two additional
 columns are added: 
\family typewriter
95pctLCL
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
95pctUCL
\family default
 which are the 95% lower and upper confidence limits, respectively.
 These confidence limits are obtained by applying the subtraction and addition,
 respectively, of 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times\sqrt{\mathbf{V}_{ii}}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}_{i}$
\end_inset

--the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 optimal parameter value.
 In this case, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{V}$
\end_inset

 is the posterior covariance, so 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{\mathbf{V}_{ii}}$
\end_inset

 is the standard deviation of the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 parameter.
 The 95% confidence limits are reported in linear space, 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 log-transformed space, so for log-transformed parameters, the upper and
 lower 95% percent confidence limits are not symmetrical about the parameter
 value.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
bgaPEST Observation Value Files 
\family typewriter
<casename>.bre.<#Oi>_<#Ii>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The observation values obtained by running the forward model with the currently
 estimated parameters are written to files called 
\family typewriter
<casename>.bre.<#Oi>_<#Ii> 
\family default
following a similar convention as with the 
\family typewriter
<casename>.bpp
\family default
 files above.
 The ascii files are printed with the following headers: 
\family typewriter
ObsName
\family default
;
\family typewriter
 ObsGroup
\family default
;
\family typewriter
 Modeled
\family default
;
\family typewriter
 Measured
\family default
.
 These files may be easily copied into a spreadsheet or read with a plotting
 program to calculate and plot residuals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Posterior Covariance File 
\family typewriter
<casename>.post.cov
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the input variable 
\family typewriter
posterior_cov_flag=1
\family default
, then posterior covariance of the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

 is calculated.
 In addition to this information being used to report 95% confidence limits
 as described above, the posterior covariance matrix is also written to
 the file 
\family typewriter
<casename>.post.cov
\family default
.
 If the variable 
\family typewriter
Q_compression_flag=1
\family default
, then compression is used for saving the prior covariance matrix.
 This is done when a large number of parameters is used and, thus, the full
 covariance matrices are unwieldy.
 Based on this choice, the posterior covariance is either reported as the
 diagonal of the posterior covariance matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(diag\left(\mathbf{V}\right)\right)$
\end_inset

 if 
\family typewriter
Q_compression_flag=1
\family default
 or the full covariance matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{V}$
\end_inset

 if 
\family typewriter
Q_compression_flag=0
\family default
.

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Posterior Covariance and Parameter log-Transformations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In this section, it was indicated that in the 
\family typewriter
<casename>.bpp.fin
\family default
 file, parameter values and 95% confidence intervals are reported in linear
 (untransformed) space while in the 
\family typewriter
<casename>.post.cov 
\family default
file, posterior covariance values are reported in estimation (log-transformed)
 space.
 Why the difference? The two files are serving slightly different purposes.
 The parameter output file presents values in the units they are entered
 in (and, presumably, the units ``seen
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by the forward model).
 As a result, 95% confidence intervals are reported in the same way.
 Furthermore, the addition and subtraction of 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times\sqrt{\mathbf{V}_{ii}}$
\end_inset

 must be applied to the parameters before back-transformation, which explains
 the asymmetry of the confidence limits.
 On the other hand, the full posterior covariance matrix is intended for
 other analysis (propagation of variance through to predictions, conditional
 realizations, and others) in which the information should be retained in
 estimation (log-transformed) space.
 In the end, the decision of how to report these values is one of convention,
 and this side box is intended to make clear which was chosen in each case.

Input Instructions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this appendix, the general strategy for input instructions is described.
 The input is arranged in a file called 
\family typewriter
<casename>.bgp
\family default
, which is made up of input blocks, as discussed below.
 Following a discussion of more detail of the general input protocols, subsectio
ns in which specific input blocks are discussed including variables and
 data that can be input in them are presented.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
General Structure of Input
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The general input structure is designed on a subset of the JUPITER protocol
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "BantaEtAl2006"

\end_inset

.
 The advantage of this protocol over XML or the previous input format for
 PEST is that annotations that are easily read by humans are part of the
 input protocol.
 The full JUPITER protocol, however, has memory and computational overhead
 that can become a problem for large and complicated data sets.
 The protocol used here, therefore, is simplified but should be easily recogniza
ble to users of other JUPITER-compatible programs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strategy for input is designed to use 
\family typewriter
BLOCKS
\family default
 that are made up of either 
\family typewriter
KEYWORDS
\family default
 for individual variables or 
\family typewriter
TABLES
\family default
 for a series of data.
 The specification of whether a given block uses 
\family typewriter
KEYWORDS
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
TABLES
\family default
 is preordained and the input blocks defined below indicate which is required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Blocks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Input Blocks are allowed to take one of two forms: either 
\family typewriter
KEYWORDS 
\family default
or
\family typewriter
 TABLES
\family default
.
 All input blocks are delineated by the words 
\family typewriter
BEGIN
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
END
\family default
.
 The header line also includes the name and type of the block and the final
 line contains the name of the block.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
BEGIN prior_mean_cv KEYWORDS
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

prior_betas=1
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

beta_cov_form = 0
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

END prior_mean_cv
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Keywords
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Keyword variables correspond to single values identifies with an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

=
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sign.
 Multiple 
\family typewriter
KEYWORDS
\family default
 can be entered on each line in an input file but no spaces are allowed
 in 
\family typewriter
KEYWORDS
\family default
 names or variable values.
 An example is: 
\family typewriter
prior_betas=1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Tables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table variables are used for tabular data series that have multiple values
 in categories.
 Tables are identified by listing the number of rows (
\family typewriter
nrow
\family default
), number of columns (
\family typewriter
ncol
\family default
), and providing the keyword 
\family typewriter
columnlabels
\family default
.
 This is followed by 
\family typewriter
nrow
\family default
 rows of data, with values arranged in 
\family typewriter
ncol
\family default
 columns, corresponding to the same order as the 
\family typewriter
columnlabels
\family default
, and delimited by one or more spaces.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
BEGIN Q_compression_cv TABLE
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

nrow=2 ncol=5 columnlabels 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

BetaAssoc Toep_flag Nrow Ncol Nlay 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

1 0 21 21 1 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

2 1 21 21 1 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

END Q_compression_cv
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Files 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A user may want to shorten the length of the main input file by redirecting
 certain input to external text files.
 This can be done by signaling an input block with the word 
\family typewriter
FILES
\family default
, to read a file containing the entire set of information for the block.
 Regardless of whether the external text file contains a 
\family typewriter
KEYWORDS
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
TABLE
\family default
 block, a block definition must be in place directing the program to the
 external file.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
BEGIN Q_compression_cv FILE 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

compression.txt
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

END Q_compression_cv
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this example, the contents of the file compression.txt would be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
BEGIN Q_compression_cv TABLE 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

nrow=2 ncol=5 columnlabels 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

BetaAssoc Toep_flag Nrow Ncol Nlay 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

1 0 21 21 1 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

2 1 21 21 1 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

END Q_compression_cv
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
bgaPEST Input Blocks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The specific input blocks used in bgaPEST are discussed, in order of appearance
 in the 
\family typewriter
<casename>.bgp
\family default
 file.
 For each block, data types are identified either as 
\emph on
float
\emph default
, 
\emph on
integer
\emph default
, or 
\emph on
string
\emph default
.
 Values entered as 
\emph on
float
\emph default
 can include scientific/engineering notation, but in all cases should contain
 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 even if no fractional detail is included.
 Conversely, 
\emph on
integers
\emph default
 must not contain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Variables identified as 
\emph on
string
\emph default
 may not include spaces because whitespace is used as the delimiter for
 rows in tables and separating keywords.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each block is also defined with a suffix of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cv
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

control variables,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

data
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for data.
 Control variables are those that govern the behavior of the algorithm as
 a whole as opposed to data points (such as parameter values, structural
 parameter values, etc.).

\begin_layout Paragraph*
A note on default variable values
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the input instructions below, some variables list a default value.
 Part of the design strategy of this software was to not burden users with
 determining appropriate values for each and every variable that controls
 the algorithm.
 As a result, default values are provided for some variables.
 In those cases, input by the user in the 
\family typewriter
.bgp
\family default
 file is optional.
 If no value is provided by the user, the default value will be used by
 bgaPEST.
 If a variable not listed with a default value in these input instructions
 is omitted by a user, bgaPEST will return with an error indicating that
 the variable is not present.

 diagonal matrix.
 These options are discussed below.

The first line of a matrix file contains 3 integers.
 The first two indicate the number of rows (
\family typewriter
NROW
\family default
) and number of columns (
\family typewriter
NCOL
\family default
) in the following matrix.
 The next integer (named 
\family typewriter
ICODE
\family default
) is a code, the role of which will be discussed shortly.
 Following the header line is the matrix itself, in which entries are space-sepa
rated and wrapped to the next line if appropriate.
 The maximum line length is 500 characters, so wrapping to the next line
 must occur within 500 characters.
 It is recommended to wrap lines after 8 values and to maintain maximum
 possible precision.

 with rows of the matrix.

 and are used in 
\family typewriter
bgaPEST
\family default
 for output of the posterior covariance matrix.
 The two options for posterior covariance output both refer to square matrixes
 that have the same names of columns and rows.
 As a result, only one list of names follows the data following the string
 “
\family typewriter
* row and column names

 In this case, 
\family typewriter

 line.
 If compression is not used, the entire posterior covariance matrix is printed
 using
