Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Environmental modeling serves many purposes for managing natural resources.
 In most cases, models are made to represent physical processes such as
 groundwater flow, contaminant transport, surface water flood routing, and
 others.
 The challenge to simulate the governing equations and concepts such as
 conservation of mass and momentum is only part of the challenge.
 Once a model adequately represents the physical characteristics of the
 problem, it is still a general tool until it is calibrated to observations
 at the specific site to be managed.
 Parameter estimation and calibration are both terms describing the process
 of incorporating the site-specific information into a model making it suitable
 to be applied to management decisions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This concept is so important that one may interpret a model as a data-processing
 tool as much as a simulator of physical processes; the data processing
 being a pipeline from field observation to model parameters and ultimately
 to predictions.
 Another interpretation is a Bayesian one in which the model is a vehicle
 for updating an 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
 understanding of the system to a conditional, 
\emph on
a posteriori
\emph default
 understanding.
 This is the approach adopted in this work and will be discussed in more
 detail.
 First, however, the concept of conditionality must be emphasized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bayes' theorem is at the heart of the techniques in this report:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p\left(\mathbf{s}|\mathbf{y}\right)\propto L\left(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{s}\right)p\left(\mathbf{s}\right)\label{eq:bayes1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

 is a vector of parameter values, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 is a vector of observations, 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(\cdot\right)$
\end_inset

 indicates a probability density function (pdf), 
\begin_inset Formula $L\left(\cdot\right)$
\end_inset

 indicates a likelihood function, and 
\begin_inset Formula $|$
\end_inset

 indicates conditionality.
 In words, Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of parameters
 conditional on the observations 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(\mathbf{s}|\mathbf{y}\right)$
\end_inset

, is proportional to the prior probability of the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(\mathbf{s}\right)$
\end_inset

 updated with the likelihood function 
\begin_inset Formula $L\left(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{s}\right)$
\end_inset

 that expresses how well 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 is estimated using the model and a candidate parameter set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

.
 The pdfs in all cases are assumed to follow Gaussian distributions.
 This assumption is important and somewhat restrictive, but it is made for
 reasons of computational simplicity.
 Active research is ongoing on alternatives to this approach, but the Gaussian
 assumption is adopted in this report.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Bayesian context, by expressing the parameters and the likelihood
 function as probability distributions, they formally incorporate an estimate
 of their uncertainty rather than being treated as perfectly known values.
 All 
\emph on
a posteriori 
\emph default
(also called posterior) distributions are conditional upon the specific
 data used in the calibration process.
 Implicitly, they are also conditional on all other modeling and data decisions
 that go into formulating the problem: which model and what model options
 are chosen, numerical considerations such as discretization and solver
 convergence criteria, boundary conditions that may or may not be considered
 static and known, variance values and weights given to individual observations
 and parameters, and others.
 The point is, if any of these things change, it is expected, in the Bayesian
 context, that the parameters estimated will also change.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As discussed in the previous paragraph, the conditionality includes 
\emph on
all 
\emph default
decisions made in the process of constructing a model and incorporating
 data.
 Not all of this information is explicit, however.
 In fact, the only 
\emph on
explicit 
\emph default
conditionality is on the data.
 The information contained in the prior pdf (
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(\mathbf{s}\right)$
\end_inset

) in eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:bayes1"

\end_inset

 is critical as well because this represents the state of knowledge about
 the parameters in the system prior to updating through the calibration
 process.
 In BGA, the assumptions made prior calibration are limited to an assumption
 of the mean value of each facies association, and a characteristic about
 continuity or smoothness of the parameter field.
 The degree to which this characteristic is enforced is dictated by the
 data and the subsequent performance of the model.
 This is very similar (and in some cases, mathematically equivalent) to
 Tikhonov regularization.
 Limiting the information assumed 
\emph on
a priori 
\emph default
is similar to assuming an ignorance prior (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
after "chapter 12"
key "jaynesBook"

\end_inset

) such that the driver of the problem is more the data than prior assumptions.
 Additionally, so-called structural parameters that enforce the characteristic
 are estimated using restricted maximum likelihood.
 All of these aspects of the algorithm, taken together, may be considered
 an Empirical Bayes approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The likelihood function in eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:bayes1"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $L\text{\left(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{s}\right) }$
\end_inset

, expresses the correspondence of model outcomes with field observations
 collocated in space and time.
 This correspondence is expressed as the sum of the squared differences
 between outcomes and observations, weighted by a covariance matrix.
 This is effectively equivalent to the weighted measurement objective function
 in PEST.

\begin_layout Section
Purpose and Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This Report is intended to serve two main purposes.
 First, a Bayesian approach to parameter estimation--expressing in the context
 of the Bayesian Geostatistical Inverse Method (BGA)--is introduced to provide
 a framework for moving a model from a general simulator of a physical process
 to a specific tool, based on a set of calibration information, that can
 be used for management of a particular site and issue.
 Second, a computer code--bgaPEST--is introduced and documented in which
 BGA is deployed in a framework based on the free and open-source PEST suite
 of software 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "PEST"

\end_inset

.
 The input framework is consistent with the JUPITER project 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "BantaEtAl2006"

\end_inset

.
 This marks the first implementation of BGA available for general use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This initial implementation is written in FORTRAN-90 with limited capabilities
 in Python.
 For users on the Windows operating system, installation of Python is optional
 as the Python codes are compiled into executables using py2exe that can
 be called by the main program.
 For users on Macintosh or Linux systems, all the code must be compiled
 for the native platform and Python should already be installed so the Python
 scripts may be called directly without need to compile them separately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part of the approach, as discussed elsewhere in this Report, is based on
 a distributed paramaterization scheme meant to be flexible in that certain
 regions of the model (called facies associations) are assigned a unique
 parameter value to be estimated for each model node or cell.
 This leads to a large number of parameters which is accompanied by computationa
l challenges.
 Some of these challenges are alleviated by restricting facies associations
 in which distributed parameterization schema are implemented to have constant
 spacing in both lateral directions and must have consistent layer thickness.
 These three value need only be constant in their respective dimensions
 but they may differ from dimension to dimension.
 This restriction allows for implementation of a Toeplitz compression making
 it possible to use many more parameters than would otherwise be possible.
 The partitioning into facies associations makes it easy to combine distributed
 parameters in areas of most interest and where data are more available,
 and homogeneous zones in areas surrounding the main focus.

\begin_layout Section
Bayesian Geostatistical Inversion Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Bayesian geostatistical inverse method is described in detail in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "KitanidisVomvoris1983,HoeksemaKitanidis1984a,Kitanidis1995,NowakCirpka2004"

\end_inset

 among others.
 In this section, we provide an overview of the method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The core of the Bayesian geostatistical inverse method is Bayes' theorem,
 which states
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p(\mathbf{s|y})\propto L(\mathbf{y|s})p(\mathbf{s})\label{eq:bayes}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\series bold

\series default
 are the measured data, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

 are the unknown parameters, 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\mathbf{s|y})$
\end_inset

 is the posterior probability density function (pdf) of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

 given 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $L(\mathbf{y|s})$
\end_inset

 is the likelihood function, and 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\mathbf{s})$
\end_inset

 is the prior pdf of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

.
 Details of these pdfs are explained below.

\end_inset

 depicts one-dimensional distributions graphically illustrating Equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:bayes"

\end_inset

.
 In this example, the prior distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p\left(\mathbf{s}\right)\right)$
\end_inset

 is diffuse, meaning the variance is relatively high and, correspondingly,
 commitment to a particular value is low.
 The likelihood function 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(L\left(\mathbf{y|s}\right)\right)$
\end_inset

 , on the other hand, has lower variance, suggesting a process that brings
 a higher level of certainty to the estimation of the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{s}\right)$
\end_inset

 than is indicated by the prior distribution only.
 The resulting posterior distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p\left(\mathbf{s|y}\right)\right)$
\end_inset

 is a convolution of the prior and likelihood functions.
 The peak is shifted significantly from the prior toward the likelihood
 and is higher.
 The posterior distribution also has lower variance than the prior as illustrate
d by the spread in the figure.
 Since the likelihood function is more focused (less spread) and higher
 than the prior, the attributes of the likelihood contribute more to the
 posterior than the prior does.

 mean (mapped onto the parameter field through the

In hydrogeologic applications, the numerical forward model is typically
 nonlinear.
 Provided that the nonlinearities introduced are not too extreme, a solution
 can be obtained through successive linearizations following the quasi-linear
 extension 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The forward model, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{h(s)}$
\end_inset

 is expanded about the current best estimate of the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\tilde{s}}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\tilde{H}}$
\end_inset

, as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\tilde{s,}}$
\end_inset

 is evaluated at each linearization.
 Linearizations are performed until the change in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\tilde{s}}$
\end_inset

 in successive iterations does not change over a specified tolerance.
 We assign the subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $_{k}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $k^{th}$
\end_inset

 linearization as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{y}_{k}^{'}=\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{h}(\tilde{\mathbf{s}}_{k})+\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{k}\tilde{\mathbf{s}}_{k}.
\]

\end_inset

Then the cokriging equations (Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) are updated
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\begin{array}{cc}

\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{Q}}_{\mathbf{yy},k}=\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{k}\mathbf{Q_{ss}}\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{k}^{T}+\mathbf{R}$
\end_inset

 From this set of equations, the next estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{\mathbf{s}}_{k+1}=\mathbf{X\hat{\beta}}_{k}+\mathbf{Q_{ss}}\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{k}^{T}\mathbf{\xi}_{k}.
\]

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
This can be iterated until there is no difference in the parameter estimates,
 or when there is no further improvement in the objective function.
 In many cases, numerical instability makes convergence difficult.
 A modified Levenberg-Marquardt approach is adopted for this work which
 splits the system in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The objective function to minimize is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{-}\ln p\left(\mathbf{s|y}\right)$
\end_inset

 which is equivalent to maximizing Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{L}=\mathbf{-}\ln p\left(\mathbf{s|y}\right)=(\mathbf{s-X\beta}^{*})^{T}\mathbf{G_{\mathbf{ss}}^{-1}}(\mathbf{s-X\beta^{*}})+\left(\mathbf{y-h}(\mathbf{s})\right)^{T}\mathbf{R^{-1}\left(\mathbf{y-h}(\mathbf{s})\right)}

\begin_layout Standard
We adopt an empirical Bayes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Robbins1956,casella1985"

\end_inset

 approach to inference in this method meaning that the general characteristics
 of the prior and epistemic covariances introduced above are provided in
 the model setup, but the values of structural parameters that control the
 balance between smoothness and misfit are estimated from the data.
 In equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:BGA"

\end_inset

 the structural parameter for 
\begin_inset Formula $L\left(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{s}\right)$
\end_inset

 is the epistemic uncertainty parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\sigma_{R}^{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 and the structural parameters for 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(\mathbf{s}\right)$
\end_inset

 are covariance parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\theta\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Estimating the structural parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\sigma_{R}^{2}\mbox{ and \mbox{\theta}}\right)$
\end_inset

 from the data is performed using Restricted Maximum Likelihood as discussed
 in Appendix A in the supplemental online material.
 This approach is consistent with the principle of maximum entropy such
 that the smoothest solution is chosen, based on the structural parameters
 estimated from the data.
 For a discussion of subtle formal differences from the principle of maximum
 entropy, see

An extension to this approach is the inclusion of information about the
 prior mean 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "NowakCirpka2004"

\end_inset

.
 The mean is estimated in the solution, but a prior value and covariance
 can be supplied to constrain the estimate.
 Typically, a relatively high covariance magnitude is used so the information
 about the mean is

\end_inset

 and principally serves the role of providing numerical stability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The forward model is constructed to provide forecasts of values collocated
 in space and time with the measured observations.
 The likelihood function brings the observed data into the calculation by
 quantifying the difference (misfit) between the model forecasts and collocated
 observations.
 In all modeling, we must acknowledge that perfect correspondence between
 forecasts and observations is neither attainable nor desirable.
 The observations themselves are corrupted by measurement errors and there
 is usually a lack of perfect correspondence between the exact nature of
 the measurements and the simulated counterparts.
 This corruption is due to uncertainty from sources including the paucity
 of observations, imperfections in the conceptual model, and approximations
 made to codify the physics of the phenomena into a numerical model framework.
 All of these sources of uncertainty are described by the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

epistemic uncertainty
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "p. 4"
key "Rubin2003"

\end_inset

.
 This epistemic uncertainty characterizes the expected misfit between forecasts
 and observations, and is expressed through a covariance function.
 As a result, the likelihood function can be characterized by a Gaussian
 distribution with zero mean and covariance defined by the epistemic uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With both the prior pdf and likelihood function expressed as Gaussian distributi
ons, the posterior pdf (found through equation 11 in Appendix A of the supplemen
tary online material) is also Gaussian.
 The values of the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

 that result in the maximum value of the posterior pdf are therefore the
 most likely solution on a point-by-point basis.
 The solution as a whole is always a somewhat smoothed version of reality,
 but the small-scale variability can be characterized through conditional
 realizations.
 The balance between the strength of smoothing and the closeness of corresponden
ce between forecasts and observations is found through calculation of optimal
 values for the structural parameters, including a value to quantify the
 epistemic uncertainty.

In an idealized problem, a single covariance model is flexible enough to
 encompass the entire variability of the hydraulic parameters.
 However, in many hydrogeologic applications, lithologic contacts and unconformi
ties can create discontinuities in parameter values that a single covariance
 model cannot characterize.
 Partitioning the field based on either the data 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 or through interrogation of preliminary solutions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 can greatly improve results.
 This partitioning is implemented by imposing discontinuities in the stochastic
 field that censor correlation between all cells that do not occur in the
 same partition.
 In this context,

 of the parameter field) but we emphasize here that the locations of the

For hydrogeologic applications, we adopted the term

facies association
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from the facies architecture field to describe these partitions.
 The term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

facies association

\end_inset

 typically refers to descriptive properties of a subset of a medium in the
 field or at least for a specific project.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Architectural elements

 defined, (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
 It is appropriate to use the less restrictive and less transferable term
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

facies association
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in this work because when we subdivide the correlation structure of the
 medium, we often base the stochastic discontinuities (bounding surfaces,
 or contacts) on perceived hydraulic properties.
 These properties will often coincide with differences in age, provenance,
 or depositional environment, but such coincidence is not required for or
 by their use.
 In all cases, partitioning into facies associations must be based on readily
 observable hydrologic or lithologic attributes.

For bgaPEST to be a more general tool (not limited to hydrogeologic modeling),
 we have revised this term to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

beta association.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 As shown in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:bestest"

\end_inset

, the Greek letter 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 stands for the mean of a region of distributed parameters.
 Beta associations can, therefore, delineate regions of a distributed parameter
 field that have similar statistical properties and correspond to the same
 mean value.
 However, importantly, beta associations can also refer to completely different
 parameter types (for example, hydraulic conductivity and storativity).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To clarify our terminology in this work, partitions delineated by stochastic
 discontinuity within a distributed parameter field are referred to as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

beta associations,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 whereas zones of piecewise continuity are referred to as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

homogeneous zones.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The beta associations delineate sub-regions of the model domain that share
 correlation characteristics and are uncorrelated from neighboring beta
 associations; they are usually delineated by features that are easily identifie
d in measured data or geologic conceptualizations of a given site area.
 In beta associations, variability of parameter values within each cell
 is allowed and constrained by the a priori covariance structure, whereas
 in homogeneous zones, a single parameter value represents the property
 for the entire zone.
 Beta associations also delineate regions in the model (whether defined
 by one or more parameter values) that are of different types.

Parameter Field Anisotropy

\begin_layout Standard
In distributed parameter fields, such as hydraulic conductivity in groundwater
 models, it is common to encounter anisotropy along an axis that may or
 not be aligned with the coordinate (x, y, z) axes.
 bgaPEST allows the definition of anisotropy in a horizontal plane at any
 angle from the x-axis and also in the vertical direction.
 The general layout of horizontal anisotropy is illustrated in Figure

 For every pair of points, they must first be rotated into the principal

 First, the prior covariance matrix

 covariance between cells of different zones.
 It is not required that the covariance model be the same for each zone.
 If different covariance models are used for different zones, this is reflected

 Furthermore, in some applications, a single structural parameter, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta,$
\end_inset

 may be estimated and applied to all of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Q_{ss}.}$

 Linearizations are performed until the change in

 We assign the subscript

Structural Parameters

\begin_layout Standard
A vital element to the method outlined above is proper selection of the
 structural parameters.
 Structural parameters, also called hyperparameters, are the parameters
 that characterize the covariance structure of both the epistemic uncertainty
 related to the observations, and the variability of the parameters.
 In this work, structural parameters include the epistemic uncertainty term
 in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $\left(\sigma_{R}^{2}\right)$

\family default
, which is made up of input blocks, as discussed below.
 Following a discussion of more detail of the general input protocols, subsectio

General Structure of Input

\begin_layout Standard
The general input structure is designed on a subset of the JUPITER protocol
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "BantaEtAl2006"

\end_inset

.
 The advantage of this protocol over XML or the previous input format for
 PEST is that annotations that are easily read by humans are part of the
 input protocol.
 The full JUPITER protocol, however, has memory and computational overhead
 that can become a problem for large and complicated data sets.
 The protocol used here, therefore, is simplified but should be easily recogniza
ble to users of other JUPITER-compatible programs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strategy for input is designed to use 
\family typewriter
BLOCKS
\family default
 that are made up of either 
\family typewriter
KEYWORDS
\family default
 for individual variables or 
\family typewriter
TABLES
\family default
 for a series of data.
 The specification of whether a given block uses 
\family typewriter
KEYWORDS
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
TABLES
\family default
 is preordained and the input blocks defined below indicate which is required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Blocks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Input Blocks are allowed to take one of two forms: either 
\family typewriter
KEYWORDS 
\family default
or
\family typewriter
 TABLES
\family default
.
 All input blocks are delineated by the words 
\family typewriter
BEGIN
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
END
\family default
.
 The header line also includes the name and type of the block and the final
 line contains the name of the block.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
BEGIN prior_mean_cv KEYWORDS
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

prior_betas=1
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Keyword variables correspond to single values identifies with an

 sign.
 Multiple 
\family typewriter
KEYWORDS
\family default
 can be entered on each line in an input file but no spaces are allowed
 in 
\family typewriter
KEYWORDS
\family default
 names or variable values.
 An example is: 
\family typewriter
prior_betas=1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Tables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table variables are used for tabular data series that have multiple values
 in categories.
 Tables are identified by listing the number of rows (
\family typewriter
nrow
\family default
), number of columns (
\family typewriter
ncol
\family default
), and providing the keyword 
\family typewriter
columnlabels
\family default
.
 This is followed by 
\family typewriter
nrow
\family default
 rows of data, with values arranged in 
\family typewriter
ncol
\family default
 columns, corresponding to the same order as the 
\family typewriter
columnlabels
\family default
, and delimited by one or more spaces.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
BEGIN Q_compression_cv TABLE 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
nrow=2 ncol=5 columnlabels 
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
2 1 21 21 1 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
END Q_compression_cv
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Files 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A user may want to shorten the length of the main input file by redirecting
 certain input to external text files.
 This can be done by signaling an input block with the word 
\family typewriter
FILES
\family default
, to read a file containing the entire set of information for the block.
 Regardless of whether the external text file contains a 
\family typewriter
KEYWORDS
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
TABLE
\family default
 block, a block definition must be in place directing the program to the
 external file.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
BEGIN Q_compression_cv FILE 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter

\begin_layout Standard
The first line of a matrix file contains 3 integers.
 The first two indicate the number of rows (
\family typewriter
NROW
\family default
) and number of columns (
\family typewriter
NCOL
\family default
) in the following matrix.
 The next integer (named 
\family typewriter
ICODE
\family default
) is a code, the role of which will be discussed shortly.
 Following the header line is the matrix itself, in which entries are space-sepa
rated and wrapped to the next line if appropriate.
 The maximum line length is 500 characters, so wrapping to the next line
 must occur within 500 characters.
 It is recommended to wrap lines after 8 values and to maintain maximum
 possible precision.
