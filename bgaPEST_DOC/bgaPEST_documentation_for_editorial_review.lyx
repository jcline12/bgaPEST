\begin_layout Standard
bgaPEST is a highly parameterized inversion software package implementing
 the Bayesian Geostatistical Approach in a framework compatible with PEST.
 Highly parameterized inversion refers to cases in which parameters are
 distributed in space or time and are correlated with one another.
 The Bayesian aspect of bgaPEST is manifest in a basis on Bayesian probability
 theory in which prior information about parameters is formally revised
 based on the calibration dataset used for the inversion.
 Conceptually, this formalizes the conditionality of estimated parameters
 on the specific data and model available.
 The Geostatistical component of the method refers to the way in which prior
 information about the parameters is used.
 A geostatistical autocorrelation function is used to enforce structure
 on the parameters to avoid overfitting and unrealistic results.
 BGA is designed to provide the smoothest solution that is consistent with
 the data.
 Optionally, users can specify a level of fit or estimate a balance between
 fit and model complexity informed by the data.
 Examples are provided in groundwater and surface water applications but
 the possible uses expand to any distributed parameter applications.

 This BGA approach has been coded using the protocol and approach of PEST
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "PEST,PESTAdd"

\end_inset

, the most widely used computer code of its type.
 Though the BGA and PEST have been primarily applied to the environmental
 modeling field, a general view of the inverse problem is discussed here,
 one that covers most classes of problems where measurements of a system
 are used to infer system properties that create the measured value.
 Thus, this bgaPEST formulation is meant to be applicable to any class of
 inverse problem that adheres to the concepts described herein.
 In this section, we outline the conceptual framework of the method; theory,
 implementation, and instructions for use of the bgaPEST computer code version
 1.0 follow this conceptual discussion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Environmental modeling can facilitate informed management of natural resources.
 In most cases, models represent physical processes such as groundwater
 flow, contaminant transport, surface water flood routing, etc.
 Simulating the overarching physics and chemistry with governing equations
 and concepts such as conservation of mass and momentum is only part of
 what is required.
 Once a model adequately represents the processes of the problem, it is
 still only an abstract tool until estimates of the physical characteristics
 are tuned to observations from the specific area to be managed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Input values that are used by processes control the behavior of a model
 at a given site; these input values are here called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

parameters
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 They represent specific characteristics (for example, hydraulic conductivity,
 recharge rate, chemical decay rate) of the natural system encountered at
 an area of interest.
 Representative values appropriate for parameters in natural systems are
 often difficult to measure directly, however.
 Observations of system state (for example, water levels, streamflow magnitudes,
 chemical concentrations) are often easier to measure, and the model is
 chosen so that the observations of the system correspond to output values
 from the model.
 The outputs of observation data are dependent to varying degrees on the
 values of parameters.
 Therefore, changes in the simulated system state that align with observations
 allow inference of parameter values not available by direct measurement.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Parameter estimation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

calibration
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are both terms describing the process of incorporating site-specific observatio
ns to inform parameters and salient processes of a model in order to improve
 its representativeness and predictive ability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A model, therefore, can often be thought of as a data-processing tool that
 quantitatively tests conceptualizations of a system as much as a simulator
 of physical processes, the data processing being a pipeline from field
 observation to model parameters and ultimately to more representative predictio
ns for supporting management decisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Put in terms of a Bayesian description, this process is one in which the
 model is a vehicle for updating soft- or expert-knowledge (called 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
 understanding in the Bayesian context) of the system.
 This initial vehicle is filtered by a measure of its ability to simulate
 the natural world informed, or updated, by site-specific observations (called
 
\emph on
a posteriori
\emph default
 understanding).
 In the Bayesian approach, the ability to simulate features of the natural
 world 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conditions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or narrows the wide range of possible outcomes that result from general
 expert and soft-knowledge alone.
 A key benefit of the Bayesian approach is that it provides a theoretically
 rigorous way to continually incorporate new information and, in turn, update
 
\emph on
a posteriori
\emph default
 understanding.

Purpose and Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This Report is intended to serve two purposes.
 First, a Bayesian approach to parameter estimation--expressed in the context
 of the Bayesian Geostatistical Approach (BGA)--is described to provide
 an accessible and general tool for moving a model from a general simulator
 of a physical process to a more optimal tool, tuned to a set of calibration
 information, which, in turn, can be used for improved prediction and decision-m
aking.
 Second, a computer code--bgaPEST version 1.0--is introduced and documented
 in which BGA is deployed using the protocols and input/output concepts
 developed in the free and open-source PEST suite of software 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 This report provides details on the mathematical theory behind BGA, followed
 by detailed instructions for using the computer program.
 Conventions and assumptions for using the program are also included in
 the discussion.
 To our knowledge, this marks the first implementation of a general BGA
 code available for general use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bgaPEST input framework is consistent with the input block and keyword
 concepts described by the JUPITER project 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Although the relation of design concepts is beyond the scope of this report,
 the input block and keywords needed to run bgaPEST are described fully
 in Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 A full description of the format of the general approach of template and
 instruction files are also not included here: detailed descriptions are

\end_inset

.
 All options implemented in template and instruction files in PEST are available
 in bgaPEST.
 A distributed parameterization scheme is discussed in this report that
 is facilitates the introduction of flexibility to the model.
 This parameterization schemes described here can be applied to any region
 of interest and with sufficient data in the model, and at the extreme can
 allow a modeler to estimate a unique parameter values for each model node
 or cell.
 This leads to a large number of parameters which is accompanied by computationa
l challenges; alleviating these computational challenges is an active area
 of ongoing research and thus are not covered in detail here.

Background for a Bayesian Geostatistical Approach

\begin_layout Standard
The presentation of the BGA is first presented using primarily description
 by words, then described later using a mathematical approach, which is
 provided in detail in Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:methodologyDetails"

\end_inset

.
 Those most interested in simply applying bgaPEST to their specific problem
 will likely spend most time with the former presentation.
 In either presentation, the concept of conditionality is fundamental.
 This concepts is expressed here as.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bayes' theorem,which forms the foundation of the techniques described in
 the rest of this report: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p\left(\mathbf{s}|\mathbf{y}\right)\propto L\left(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{s}\right)p\left(\mathbf{s}\right)\label{eq:bayes1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

 is an 
\begin_inset Formula $m\times1$
\end_inset

 vector of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 parameter values, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times1$
\end_inset

 vector of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 observations, 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(\cdot\right)$
\end_inset

 indicates a probability density function (pdf), 
\begin_inset Formula $L\left(\cdot\right)$
\end_inset

 indicates a likelihood function, and 
\begin_inset Formula $|$
\end_inset

 indicates conditionality.
 In words, Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of parameters
 conditional on the observations 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(\mathbf{s}|\mathbf{y}\right)$
\end_inset

 (often referred to simply as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the posterior probability of 
\series bold
s
\series default
 given 
\series bold
y
\series default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), is proportional to the prior probability of the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(\mathbf{s}\right)$
\end_inset

 updated with the likelihood function 
\begin_inset Formula $L\left(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{s}\right)$
\end_inset

 that expresses how well 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 is estimated using the model and a candidate parameter set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

.
 The pdfs in all cases are assumed to follow or at least be well-approximated
 by Gaussian distributions.
 This assumption is important and somewhat restrictive, but is made for
 computational simplicity.
 Active research is ongoing on alternatives to this approach, but the traditiona
l Gaussian assumption is adopted in this report and is still considered
 a practical and useful assumption for many cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Bayesian context, expressing the parameters and the likelihood function
 as probability distributions formally incorporates an estimate of their
 uncertainty rather than treating the parameters as perfectly known values.
 All 
\emph on
a posteriori 
\emph default
(also called posterior) distributions are conditional upon the specific
 data used in the calibration process.
 Perhaps less obviously, posterior distributions are also conditional on
 all other modeling and data assumptions and decisions that go into formulating
 the problem: which model and what model options are chosen, numerical considera
tions such as discretization and solver convergence criteria, boundary condition
s that may or may not be considered static and known, variance values and
 weights given to individual observations and parameters, and others.
 As a result, if any of these underlying assumptions and decisions change,
 it is expected, in the Bayesian context, that the parameters estimated
 and the associated posterior uncertainty will also change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conditionality includes 
\emph on
all 
\emph default
decisions made in the process of constructing a model and incorporating
 data, however, not all of this information is explicitly addressed by the
 modeler.
 In fact, the only 
\emph on
explicit 
\emph default
conditionality is on the observation data.
 The information contained in the prior pdf (
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(\mathbf{s}\right)$
\end_inset

) in eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:bayes1"

\end_inset

 is critical because it represents the state of knowledge about the parameters
 in the system prior to updating through the calibration process.
 In this report, assumptions made prior to calibration are intentionally
 limited and are restricted to the assignment of a mean value (unknown)
 of each distinct parameter type and region within the model domain (beta
 association--described below), and a characteristic about continuity or
 smoothness of the parameter field (implemented as a variogram--also described
 below).
 The degree to which this continuity characteristic is enforced is dictated
 by the observations included and the subsequent performance of the model.
 This construction is similar (and in some cases, mathematically equivalent)
 to Tikhonov regularization 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Tikhonov1963a,Tikhonov1963b,AsterEtal2005"

\end_inset

.
 Limitation of the information assumed 
\emph on
a priori 
\emph default
is similar to assuming a low or diffuse level of 
\emph on
a priori 
\emph default
soft-knowledge (called an ignorance prior in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
after "chapter 12"
key "jaynesBook"

\end_inset

).
 In this case, the resulting model is driven more by information obtained
 from site-specific observations than from prior assumptions based on soft-knowl
edge.
 A goal of this approach is to limit the subjective information used in
 favor of an objective and repeatable result based on observation data.
 Additionally, so-called structural parameters that enforce the characteristic
 smoothness are estimated.
 An algorithm that encompasses all of these aspects is considered an Empirical
 Bayes approach.

The concept of a beta association is an important one that is revisited

 describe the need to to represent the generalized mean value for a specific
 parameter type (for example, hydraulic conductivity in a groundwater model)
 in a specific region of a model a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

facies association.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 To be more general, this concept is incorporated here by the use of the
 term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

beta
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, derived from the mathematical symbol used.
 .
 In the methodology described in this report, parameter values are estimated
 by estimating a mean value (termed 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 in the mathematics) and fluctuations about that mean.
 Each parameter, therefore, must be associated with a mean value.

 In applications appropriate for bgaPEST,

 It would be tempting to use another term such as

zone
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

facies
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to describe this concept, but the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

beta association
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 was selected specifically to highlight the flexibility of the concept.
 The important idea is that the method described in bgaPEST depends on being
 able to associate each parameter with a mean value.
 In the case of distributed parameters (for example, hydraulic conductivity
 or recharge being distributed throughout a region in a model in which each
 model cell or node is assigned a unique value), the subdivision of the
 entire model domain into beta associations accounts for hydrogeologic contacts
 or facies to be delineated.
 This delineation assumes that there is little or no correlation across
 these natural divisions.
 Similarly, parameters of one type are typically not correlated with parameters
 of a different type.
 Beta associations allow the inclusion of multiple parameter types and the
 delineation of important geologic features in distributed parameter sets.
 In the BGA algorithm, parameters in different beta associations are assigned
 zero correlation.

, 
\begin_inset Formula $L\text{\ensuremath{\left(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{s}\right)}}$
\end_inset

, expresses the correspondence of model outcomes with field observations
 collocated in space and time.
 This correspondence is expressed as the sum of the squared differences
 between outcomes and observations, weighted by a covariance matrix, which
 expresses the relative certainty of each observation.
 This is equivalent to the weighted measurement objective function in PEST
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The advantages to the Bayesian approach stem from the conceptual framework,
 the ability to use a a probability density function to represent parameterizati
on rather than single values , and the empirical nature of the balance between
 prior information and likelihood.
 These elements of Bayes' equation form the fundamental basis for the bgaPEST
 software described here.

 Geostatistics is a form a interpolation that uses a spatial function called
 a variogram to fill in information between data points.
 The most common technique of geostatistics is called Kriging.
 In this section, we discuss geostatistics in a conceptual way using a photograp
hic image as an example.
 The mathematics relevant to BGA are discussed in later sections.

 software for using the technique are found in

The photograph in the left panel of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 is a JPG taken on a digital camera.
 As a grayscale image, the information of the image can be stored in a matrix
 with the number of rows and columns, 320 rows and 240 columns in this case,
 indicating the number of pixels in the vertical and horizontal dimensions,
 respectively.
 The values at each pixel are a brightness value, in this case normalized
 to a maximum value of 64.0.
 In the original image, there are 
\begin_inset Formula $320\times240=76,800$
\end_inset

 pixels, each of which may be considered a discrete packet of information.
 To illustrate the Kriging process, the photograph was first subsampled
 on an evenly spaced grid of 30 rows and 20 columns with the brightness
 value retained at each location.
 This results in a greatly reduced set of information containing 
\begin_inset Formula $30\times20=600$
\end_inset

 pixels.
 In the photograph in the right panel of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:mikephoto"

\end_inset

, the faint impression of the subsampling grid is visible in some areas
 as the subsampled values are depicted at those locations.
 Using the geostatistical technique of Kriging with an appropriate variogram,
 it is possible to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fill in
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the missing data between subsampled data points to present a full image
 of the matrix but with substantially less detail than the original.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main role of the variogram in geostatistics and, indeed, in BGA, is
 to act as a constraint, controlling the shape of the interpolated values
 filling in between the known data values.
 In BGA, this connection is not quite as direct as in the photograph interpolati
on example, but it is useful to think of the variogram (as a quantification
 of the prior pdf) as a control on the shape of the estimated parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Various other interpolation techniques could be used to fill in the missing
 data and each would have its own degree of information loss or smoothing
 relative to the original.
 Kriging has a long history of use in earth science applications and, while
 the interpolated image is much smoother than the original image, there
 is more shape and information than if, for example, linear interpolation
 was used to fill the values between each data point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The variogram used in Kriging is an empirical function that characterizes
 the difference between a property as a function of separation distance.
 To determine a variogram appropriate for a problem, the first step is to
 plot a variogram function (a function of difference in property value)
 against separation distance (depicted as red 'x' marks in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 Next, a function type is selected from a family of valid variogram model
 types.
 In the photograph example an exponential variogram is used.
 Later in this report, more mathematical details about variograms and variogram
 choice are presented.

Returning to the geostatistical aspect of BGA, a variogram model is used
 as the prior information in the Bayesian construction.
 As discussed above, a goal of BGA is to specify little information in the
 prior and to allow the information contained in the calibration data set
 to inform the results as much as possible.
 This is accomplished by specifying only the family of variogram model used
 rather than specifying its specific shape.
 Using the example in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:varill"

\end_inset

, the family of variogram (in this case exponential) indicates only that
 function will assume a curvilinear shape; the specific parameters or the
 variogram function dictate the rate of curvature.
 In terms of using a variogram for the prior distribution in BGA, specifying
 the variogram type only informs the most general characteristic of the
 field (for example, the field must be continuous and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

smooth
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 The degree to which this characteristic is enforced is controlled by the
 calibration data set.

 In this example, the prior distribution

 is diffuse, meaning the variance is relatively high and, correspondingly,
 commitment to a particular value is low.
 The likelihood function 
\begin_inset Formula $L\left(\mathbf{y|s}\right)$

, on the other hand, has lower variance, suggesting a process that brings
 a higher level of certainty to the estimation of the parameters

 than is indicated by the prior distribution only.
 The resulting posterior distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(\mathbf{s|y}\right)$

 is a convolution of the prior and likelihood functions.
 The peak is shifted significantly from the prior toward the likelihood
 and is narrower, representing less uncertainty.

In bgaPEST, an empirical Bayes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 perspective is adopted.
 Empirical Bayes means that the general characteristics of the prior and
 (optionally) epistemic covariances introduced above are provided in the
 model setup, but the values of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

structural
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 parameters that control the structure of the system--the balance between
 smoothness and misfit--are estimated from the observation data.
 In other words, the level of roughness in the solution is dictated by the
 information content of the observation data rather than specified by the
 user ahead of time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The prior distribution is the main mechanism by which soft-knowledge about
 the parameter field is imparted on the parameter estimation process.
 In the Empirical Bayes perspective, this soft-knowledge is intentionally
 limited such that significant flexibility is available to the algorithm
 and a specific practitioner's preconceived notions, which are more subjective,
 are replaced by the objective power of the site-specific observations.
 This idea is inspired, also, by the concept of multiple working hypotheses
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Chamberlin warned of scientists falling victim to a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

paternalistic affection
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for his or her initial explanation of a phenomenon such that they are blind
 to other explanations that may be more appropriate.
 This is not to discount the value of soft-knowledge--indeed, the general
 characteristics imparted through specification of the prior information
 and the interpretation of the results of using BGA rely deeply on expertise--bu
t it highlights a goal of leaving as much flexibility as possible in the
 process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In bgaPEST, then, the practitioner specifies a type of variogram (nugget,
 linear, or exponential) that is used to control the variability--smoothness
 or roughness--of parameters within a beta association, but the 
\emph on
degree
\emph default
 to which this characteristic is enforced is determined by restricted maximum
 likelihood (RML).
 In RML, the value of structural parameters that control the variogram behavior
 is treated as a probability distribution and the most likely values resulting
 in either the best possible fit (if the epistemic error term is estimated)
 or a user-specific level of fit (if the epistemic error term is fixed)
 are estimated.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fit,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in this context, refers to the correspondence between observation data
 and model outputs collocated in space and time with the measured observations.
 Fit and epistemic error are discussed in more detail in the next section.
 A danger, when providing a model with substantial flexibility, is an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

overly complex
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 model that is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

overfit

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

before "e.g. "
key "drapersmith66,Hill2006"

\end_inset

.
 To mitigate this issue, the RML approach is consistent with the principle
 of maximum entropy such that the smoothest solution is chosen, based on
 the structural parameters estimated from the data.
 For a discussion of subtle formal differences from minimum relative entropy,

\begin_layout Standard
An extension to this approach is the inclusion of information about the
 prior mean 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "NowakCirpka2004"

\end_inset

.
 Although the mean is estimated in the solution, a prior value and covariance
 can be supplied to constrain the estimate.
 Typically, a relatively high covariance magnitude is used so the constraint
 on the estimated mean is weak or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

diffuse.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Thus the prior mean principally serves the role of providing numerical
 stability rather than compelling the solution to adhere closely to prior
 values.
 Similarly, prior information and covariance can be supplied on the structural
 parameters to constrain the estimated values to more closely follow an
 initial conception of the parameter field variability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The forward model is constructed to provide outputs of values collocated
 in space and time with measured observations.
 The likelihood function quantifies the difference (misfit) between the
 model simulated outputs and associated observations.
 In all modeling, perfect correspondence between forecasts and observations
 is neither attainable nor desirable.
 The observations themselves are corrupted by measurement errors and there
 is usually a lack of perfect correspondence between the exact nature of
 the measurements and the simulated counterparts.
 This corruption is due to uncertainty from sources including the paucity
 of observations, imperfections in the conceptual model, and approximations
 made to codify the physics of the phenomena into a numerical model framework.
 All of these sources of uncertainty are described by the overarching term
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

epistemic uncertainty
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "p. 4"
key "Rubin2003"

\end_inset

.
 This epistemic uncertainty characterizes the expected misfit between simulated
 and observed equivalents, and is expressed through a covariance function.
 As a result, the likelihood function can be characterized by a Gaussian
 distribution with zero mean and covariance defined by the epistemic uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With both the prior pdf and likelihood function expressed as Gaussian distributi
ons, the resulting posterior pdf is also Gaussian.
 The values of the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

 that result in the maximum value of the posterior pdf are therefore the
 most likely solution on a point-by-point basis.
 The solution as a whole is always a somewhat smoothed version of reality,
 but the influence of small-scale variability can be approximated through
 conditional realizations.
 The balance between the strength of smoothing and the level of fit between
 simulated and observed equivalents is found through calculation of optimal
 values for the structural parameters.
 Optionally, this can include a value to quantify the epistemic uncertainty.
 The result will favor smoothness, but may achieve a level of fit corresponding
 to an unrealistically low level of epistemic uncertainty.
 As a result, it is generally most appropriate to fix the level of epistemic
 uncertainty but allow the other structural parameters to be estimated.

\begin_layout Standard
In an idealized problem, a single covariance model (for example, a single
 variogram) is flexible enough to encompass the entire variability of the
 hydraulic parameters.
 However, in many hydrogeologic applications, lithologic contacts and unconformi
ties can create discontinuities in parameter values that a single covariance
 model cannot characterize.
 Partitioning the field based on either the data 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "e.g. "
key "fienenEtal2004"

\end_inset

 or through interrogation of preliminary solutions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "e.g. "
key "FienenWRR2008"

\end_inset

 can greatly improve the parameter estimation results.
 This partitioning is implemented by imposing discontinuities in the stochastic
 field that censor correlation among all cells that do not occur in the
 same partition.
 In this context, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stochastic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 refers to the entity being partitioned (namely the correlation structure
 of the parameter field) but we emphasize here that the locations of the
 imposed discontinuities are themselves considered deterministic and certain.
 This concept of partitioning is consistent with zonal boundaries in models
 made up of homogeneous zones but allows more flexibility by allowing properties
 within the zone to vary.
 Furthermore, multiple types of parameters (for example, in a flow and transport
 model, hydraulic conductivity and porosity) are commonly estimated.
 While at the physical level, these parameters may be related, they must
 correspond to different mean values, so similar censoring of correlation
 among different types of parameters is also necessary in most applications
 through partitioning.

\begin_layout Standard
For hydrogeologic applications, the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

facies association,

 from the facies architecture field, is a good description for these partitions
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

facies association
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 typically refers to descriptive properties of a subset of a medium in the
 field or at least for a specific project.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Architectural elements
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is used in the broader case where the characteristics are more formally
 defined, (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

).
 It would be appropriate to use the less restrictive and less transferable
 term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

facies association
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in hydrogeologic applications because when we subdivide the correlation
 structure of the medium, we often base the stochastic discontinuities (bounding
 surfaces, or contacts) on perceived hydraulic properties.
 These properties will often coincide with differences in age, provenance,
 or depositional environment, but such coincidence is not required for or
 by their use.
 In all cases, partitioning into facies associations are most effective
 when based on readily observable hydrologic or lithologic attributes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For bgaPEST to be a more general tool (not limited to hydrogeologic modeling),
 we have broadened this concept by adopting the term

beta association.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 As shown in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:bestest"

\end_inset

, the Greek letter 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 stands for the mean of a region of distributed parameters.
 Beta associations can, therefore, delineate regions of a distributed parameter
 field that have similar statistical properties and correspond to the same
 mean value.
 However, importantly, beta associations can also refer to completely different
 parameter types (for example, hydraulic conductivity and recharge).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To clarify our terminology in this work, partitions delineated by stochastic
 discontinuity within a distributed parameter field are referred to as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

beta associations,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 whereas zones of piecewise continuity are referred to as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

homogeneous zones.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The beta associations delineate sub-regions of the model domain that share
 correlation characteristics and are uncorrelated from neighboring beta
 associations; they are usually delineated by features that are easily identifie
d in measured data or geologic conceptualizations of a given site area.
 In beta associations, variability of parameter values within each cell
 is allowed and constrained by the 
\emph on

 covariance structure, whereas in homogeneous zones, a single parameter
 value represents the property for the entire zone.
 Beta associations also delineate regions in the model (whether defined

\begin_layout Section
bgaPEST Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of BGA concepts described previously have been restricted to primarily
 academic and/or custom applications due to non-general nature of the BGA
 coding.
 The BGA formulation used in bgaPEST is meant to make the approach generally
 available to a wider class of modeling problems.
 This generality is obtained by the following design considerations.
 The input/output design of bgaPEST follows that of the widely used PEST
 software 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "PEST,PESTAdd"

\end_inset

.
 This approach has two primary restrictions.
 First, input provided to the model, and output derived from a model, uses
 an ASCII text file format.
 This restriction can be relaxed, however, provided that a translation utility
 can be deployed that converts data of another format--for example, binary--to
 or from ASCII, as appropriate.
 Second, the model must run in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

batch
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 mode where many model runs can be called by PEST without user intervention.
 Therefore, the only kind of model that PEST cannot easily accommodate is
 one in which any changes to model input or the reading of model output
 must take place in a graphical user interface.
 This generality of model compatibility is a powerful capability that bgaPEST
 is able to take advantage of by virtue of efficient open-source modules
 that make this external control of a model possible using the same protocols
 as PEST.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As discussed below, bgaPEST must control the model for two purposes: to
 evaluate the likelihood function (assessing the correspondence between
 model output and collocated observation data, given a candidate set of
 parameter values) and to calculate the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Jacobian
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sensitivity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 matrix that is required for solving the calibration equations.
 To enable PEST (and bgaPEST) to write input for a model, template files
 are created that provide a mapping of named parameters into their proper
 place in input files for the model.
 More than one template file can be used corresponding to multiple model
 input files.
 To enable reading of output files, instruction files are created that contain
 a set of instructions (including locating specific line numbers or searching
 for specific text) that enable extraction of output values to be compared
 with site observation data.
 Leveraging the modules that implement the PEST input/output protocols takes
 advantage of the flexibility and generality of PEST.
 It also makes it possible to take advantage of some of the utility programs
 already created to be compatible with the PEST suite of software.
 Programs created using the JUPITER program employ a very similar set of
 protocols by virtue of the PEST modules being provided to the JUPITER project.
 As a result, template and instruction files created to work with a model
 are largely interchangeable among projects implemented in PEST, bgaPEST,
 and programs created using JUPITER.
 A full description of the format of template and instruction files is not
 part of the scope of this work: detailed descriptions are provided in the
 PEST documentation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

key "PEST"

\end_inset

.
 All options implemented in template and instruction files in PEST are available
 in bgaPEST.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This initial implementation is written in FORTRAN-90.
 The calculation of the Jacobian (sensitivity or derivatives) matrix can
 either be implemented using a script written by the user, or employing
 a Python script provided with bgaPEST.
 The Python script depends on several utilities that are standard with PEST
 and available for download at http://www.pesthomepage.org.
 The necessary executable files are also provided with bgaPEST.
 For users on the Windows operating system, installation of Python is optional
 as the Python codes are compiled into executables using py2exe that can
 be called by the main program.
 For users on Macintosh or Linux systems, all the code must be compiled
 for the native platform and Python should already be installed so the Python
 scripts may be called directly without need to compile them separately.
 The use of external derivatives (sensitivity) calculation with PEST and
 Python will be replaced by integration of a general parallel run management
 suite (GENIE, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) as part of future work.
 Parallelization is possible using beoPEST 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, but the entire process, including starting and stopping all parallel computer
 (slave) programs must be encapsulated in a script that is called by bgaPEST.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Running bgaPEST
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bgaPEST program uses a single input control file, template and instruction
 files to control the underlying model, and generates several output files.
 These files are discussed in the context of progression of the bgaPEST
 program in the remainder of this section.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 shows the general progression of a bgaPEST parameter estimation run.
 The entire process is controlled by variables in the input 
\family typewriter

\family default
 file discussed below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To obtain an optimal solution to the parameter estimation problem, it is
 necessary to perform multiple iterations.
 An iteration is defined as a single run of the entire estimation process
 with a particular set of values.
 Multiple iterations are required due to the nonlinearity of the problem
 and due to the necessity of estimating structural parameters separately
 from model parameters.
 Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:methodologyDetails"

\end_inset

 provides more detail about the methodology used to obtain a solution for
 a set of optimal parameters and structural parameters in bgaPEST.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Outer iterations (also called bga iterations) are wrapped around the traditional
 parameter estimation process with values of the structural parameters held
 constant.
 Inner parameter estimation iterations are performed to account for the
 (restricted maximum likelihood) estimation of structural parameters.
 If structural parameters are not chosen to be estimated, then a single
 outer iteration is performed using the initial values of structural parameters
 and inner iterations are performed until convergence or until the number
 of iterations reaches 
\family typewriter
it_max_phi
\family default
.
 If a linesearch (discussed below) is requested, this is performed within
 the inner iterations.
 If structural parameter optimization is requested, it is performed after
 convergence has occurred or maximum inner iterations are reached.
 Then, restricted maximum likelihood is performed to estimate a new set
 of structural parameters.
 The interdependence between structural parameters and model parameters
 requires reiteration of the inner iterations and structural parameter estimatio
n until both have converged or the maximum number of outer iterations has
 been reached.
 At the end of both inner and outer iteration convergence, or exceedance
 of maximum iterations, posterior covariance is calculated, if requested.

\begin_layout Subsection
bgaPEST Control Variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two types of variables are used in bgaPEST: data variables and control variables.
 Data variables are values such as model parameters, observations, file
 names, and other data that are needed by the bgaPEST program.
 Control variables, on the other hand, drive the actions that are performed
 on these data elements.
 As such, control variables are abstracted on level from data variables
 and control either the reading/writing of data or the progression of the
 algorithm.
 Many control variables are straightforward (for example, 
\family typewriter
it_max_phi
\family default
\emph on
, 
\emph default
an integer, is the total number of iterations allowed in each quasi-linear
 inner estimation optimization.
 
\emph on
default=10).

\emph default
 Such variables are defined in the context of the input instructions in
 Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Input-Instructions"

\end_inset

.
 However, other control variables are accompanied by important conventions
 regarding their impact on the performance of the algorithm.
 For these cases, in this section, more detail is provided about certain
 control variables.

 which are the 95% lower and upper confidence limits, respectively.
 These confidence limits are obtained by applying the subtraction and addition,

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}_{i}$

Suggestions and Guidelines for Initial Use

\begin_layout Standard
The Bayesian Geostatistical Approach is a highly parameterized method that
 is appropriate for some, but not all applications.
 In this section, we outline a few considerations to aid in the decision
 about whether to use bgaPEST on a given problem based on the history and
 characteristics of the method.
 We also provide a few guidelines to help avoid potential pitfalls in the
 application of bgaPEST.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This report documents the first release of bgaPEST and, to our knowledge,
 the first implementation of BGA available in a generalized package.
 As a result, users of this version will be among the first to apply this
 software outside of academia where custom programs have been the rule.
 Nonetheless, the method has a 20 year history.
 The majority of applications have been to groundwater modeling projects
 including (but not limited to): pumping test analysis

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Characteristics for Suggested Use
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The characteristics that unite these applications form a solid guide when
 deciding if bgaPEST is appropriate for a given application.
 First, and foremost, there must be a parameter set that varies either in
 space or time.
 For example, a time series of chemical concentrations (a breakthrough curve),
 a hydraulic conductivity field, a recharge field, or surface flux of atmospheri
c gasses.
 These parameters should vary continuously over reasonably substantial areas
 for a variogram to be an adequate descriptor of the shape of the parameter
 field.
 Sub-areas delineated by geologic contacts, or in the case of time series,
 punctuated by known events, can be partitioned into beta associations,
 as discussed throughout this report.
 Another consideration is a more practical one--model run time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The nature of bgaPEST is that many parameters are to be estimated.
 Throughout the parameter estimation process, a Jacobian sensitivity matrix
 must be calculated, requiring one model run per parameter.
 This computational burden must be considered and, potentially mitigated.
 In academic settings, many researchers have taken advantage of adjoint
 state techniques to make the calculation of the Jacobian matrix more efficient
 in the case where parameters greatly outnumber observations.
 Adjoint state versions of commercial and government codes are not typically
 available, however, but bgaPEST is equipped to handle Jacobian matrices
 calculated outside of bgaPEST so users who are able to write such codes
 can make use of them.
 Similarly, parallelization of the Jacobian calculations is a feature that
 will be added in the future.
 For now, through clever scripting, it is possible to use beoPEST outside
 of bgaPEST to parallelize the calculations of the Jacobian matrix.
 In this initial release of bgaPEST, however, it may be more practical to
 stick with models with short run times, run Jacobian calculations in series
 and just recognize that the computational burden may be high.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adjoint-state Jacobian calculation is an attractive method to mitigate high
 computational expense of this method.
 However, production codes for adjoint state calculations are rare.
 For more information on the technique, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "TownleyWilson1985,Sykes1985,SamperNeuman1986,RamaRao1995,neupauerWilson1999"

\end_inset

 and references therein.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A common occurrence in groundwater modeling applications is that parameters
 far exceed observations in number.
 This, of course, can change in transient simulations where, if each measurement
 in time at a single measurement location is considered an observation,
 the numbers of observations and parameters may equalize.
 bgaPEST is most appropriate for the former case--where parameters outnumber
 observations, typically by a large margin.
 Several programming and mathematical accommodations are made to enable
 the number of parameters to grow very large (testing has been performed
 with 90,000 parameters).
 However, if the number of observation grows significantly, computer memory
 will become a limitation in many cases.
 For transient problems, one should consider the information content of
 each measurement point in time.
 Often, the number of observation points can be effectively reduced by consideri
ng moments rather than discrete points

Guidelines
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The number of applications of bgaPEST this far is limited.
 As new software and a relatively novel technique, it will take time for
 users to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

get a feel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for the behavior and characteristics of the tool.
 In this section, we provide a few guidelines that we hope will help users
 avoid pitfalls.
 In future releases, building on the experience of a larger user base, more
 guidelines will become available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph*
Run Times
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a typical groundwater model, somewhere between 5 and 15 outer iterations
 will often be required.
 For each outer iteration, it is likely that about 5 inner iterations are
 necessary.
 This means up to 75 calculations of the Jacobian matrix may be required.
 Without parallelization or adjoint state, users should carefully consider
 how many parameters can be accommodated as run times grow in length.
 For planning, assume that the time required for each Jacobian calculation
 is the number of parmeters 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(m\right)$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 Run Time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph*
Beta Associations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beta associations provide the ability to include knowledge about contacts
 and other partitions in the parameter fields.
 Some beta associations can have a separate parameter value in each node,
 while others can be treated as homogeneous zones.
 This is accomplished through the design of the template file.
 In addition to allowing for the inclusion of well-known structures such
 as lithologic contacts, beta associations also allow for some regions--either
 because of greater importance to the ultimate management decisions, due
 to greater density of data, or both--to have a large number of parameters
 whereas other regions have homogeneous values.
 By only allowing a large number of parameters in focused areas of interest,
 the overall number of parameters can be reduced, thus mitigating some of
 the concerns about run times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph*
Line Search
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of the line search is similar to the purpose of the Levenberg-Marqua
rdt adjustment used in PEST.
 While the Levenberg-Marquardt search makes a correction to the search direction
 when the optimization algorithm might otherwise stray from the optimal
 direction, the linesearch adjusts the length along the Quasi-Newton direction
 to avoid overshooting.
 The linesearch, therefore, serves its greatest purpose in its first iteration
 or two.
 After that, the value of the linesearch is limited for mathematical reasons
 having to do with linearization of the problem (see Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:methodologyDetails"

\end_inset

 for more details).
 As a result, a value of between 2 and 5 for 
\family typewriter
it_max_linesearch
\family default
 in the control variables is generally adequate.
 If the linesearch algorithm does not converge, a warning will be issued
 and, while it is good to know that this took place, the linesearch has
 served its purpose and little gain will be achieved by increasing 
\family typewriter
it_max_linesearch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph*
Level of Fit
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

With great power comes great responsibility.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 In applications where parameters outnumber observations, a real danger
 lurks of overfitting.
 In other words, parameters can be adjusted to achieve a level of correspondence
 between simulated and observed equivalents that exceeds a reasonable level.
 The danger of this is that some of the 
\emph on
lack
\emph default
 of correspondence is often due to random epistemic error and is not representat
ive of actual system behavior.
 However, if the parameters are adjusted to match observations within this
 margin of error, they are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fitting the noise.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The ramifications of this are mainly a diminishment of predictive power
 of the model and unrealistic roughness of the parameter fields estimated.
 There are two means of avoiding this problem.
 One is the maximum entropy property of BGA.
 The algorithm is designed to find the 
\emph on
smoothest
\emph default
 solution consistent with the level of fit.
 If all structural parameters--including 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{R}$
\end_inset

--are estimated, the algorithm will try to achieve perfect fit with the
 smoothest solution that can do so.
 This may still lead to overfitting, however, so in most cases, it is more
 appropriate to set the level of fit using 
\family typewriter
sig_0
\family default
 in the Epistemic Error Term input block described below to a level of fit
 chosen by the user to be appropriate given known and suspected uncertainties
 about both the observation quality and the model.
 Weights on observations can account for different levels of quality in
 different observations.
 In most cases, the user should also set 
\family typewriter

 to force the algorithm to use a consistent value for epistemic uncertainty
 and thus to manually control the level of fit.
 If set this way, the algorithm will adjust the other structural parameters
 to achieve the smoothest possible solution corresponding to the specified
 level of fit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The level of smoothness in the optimal BGA solution is always smoother than
 conditional realizations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 which characterize more of the potential variability in each solution.
 In cases such as transport models where heterogeneity is the most important,
 conditional realizations (made possible using the optimal solution and
 the posterior covariance--both provided by bgaPEST) will provide a more
 precise characterization of system behavior in heterogeneity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph*
Structural Parameter Optimization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A good general guideline for all modeling is to start simple and add complexity
 as appropriate.
 In bgaPEST, this goal is achieved by starting with small values of variogram
 parameters (slope for the linear, variance for the nugget or exponential)
 such that the solution will be very smooth.
 By optimizing for structural parameters, roughness will be introduced by
 the algorithm until convergence at the optimal level of roughness.
 At the early, exploratory stages of a project, it might be desirable to
 set 
\family typewriter
sig_opt=1
\family default
 to see what level of fit may be achievable, but the user should be prepared
 to override this in later stages as allowing too much roughness to be introduce
d.
 For the prior distribution variogram parameters, however, optimization
 should always be employed in keeping with the Empirical Bayes perspective
 the algorithm was designed with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Limitations to Version 1.0
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
bgaPEST marks the first widely available implementation of BGA for use by
 practitioners.
 Limitations, of course, accompany this first implementation.
 Version 1.0 does not have an explicit parallelization facility.
 This can be overcome by using external programs for derivatives and calling
 a parallel Jacobian calculation package such a BeoPEST 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "beoPEST"

\end_inset

 or GENIE 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "GENIE"

\end_inset

 whenever a Jacobian matrix is required.
 The impact of this is on the run times required to obtain a solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A practical upper limit on the number of parameters estimated is on the
 order of 100,000.
 To estimate a larger number of parameters, machines with a large amount
 of random access memory (RAM) must be used.
 At some greater limit, methods such as periodic embedding or other decompositio
ns must be incorporated to mitigate the expense of storing and calculating
 the prior covariance matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The source code is written in Fortran-90 and should be compilable on any
 platform with a Fortran compiler.
 Special care was taken to avoid obscure and nonstandard language features.
 Nonetheless, it is possible that some platform- or compiler-specific problems
 may be encountered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to use bgaPEST with a small number of parameters, but the
 assumption from the start is that parameters in at least part of the spatio-tem
poral domain represent a field of correlated instances (e.g.
 model nodes, discrete times) that often outnumber the number of data observatio
ns.
 A combination of homogeneous parameters in zones with a refined area of
 interest that is distributed is a common application and, as implemented
 through beta associations, this mix of distributed and zoned parameters
 is supported and encouraged.
 Typically, sufficient data to support a distributed parameter set is limited
 to part of a model domain in space or time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In considering uncertainty, version 1.0 presents posterior covariance values.
 For some applications, conditional realizations may be desired to capture
 candidate roughness of solutions within the ensemble distribution of solutions.
 Details for conditional realizations are provided by

Input Instructions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this appendix, the general strategy for input instructions is described.
 The input is arranged in a file called 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Formula $<$
\end_inset

casename
\begin_inset Formula $>$
\end_inset

.bgp
\family default
, which is made up of input blocks, as discussed below.
 Following a discussion of more detail of the general input protocols, subsectio
ns in which specific input blocks are discussed including variables and
 data that can be input in them are presented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
General Structure of Input
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The general input structure is designed on a subset of the JUPITER protocol
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "BantaEtAl2006"

\end_inset

.
 The advantage of this protocol over XML or the previous input format for
 PEST is that annotations that are easily read by humans are part of the
 input protocol.
 The full JUPITER protocol, however, has memory and computational overhead
 that can become a problem for large and complicated data sets.
 The protocol used here, therefore, is simplified but should be easily recogniza
ble to users of other JUPITER-compatible programs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strategy for input is designed to use 
\family typewriter
BLOCKS
\family default
 that are made up of either 
\family typewriter
KEYWORDS
\family default
 for individual variables or 
\family typewriter
TABLES
\family default
 for a series of data.
 The specification of whether a given block uses 
\family typewriter
KEYWORDS
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
TABLES
\family default
 is preordained and the input blocks defined below indicate which is required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Blocks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Input Blocks are allowed to take one of two forms: either 
\family typewriter
KEYWORDS 
\family default
or
\family typewriter
 TABLES
\family default
.
 All input blocks are delineated by the words 
\family typewriter
BEGIN
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
END
\family default
.
 The header line also includes the name and type of the block and the final
 line contains the name of the block.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
BEGIN prior_mean_cv KEYWORDS
\family default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
prior_betas=1
\family default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
beta_cov_form = 0
\family default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
END prior_mean_cv
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Keywords
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Keyword variables correspond to single values identifies with an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

=
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sign.
 Multiple 
\family typewriter
KEYWORDS
\family default
 can be entered on each line in an input file but no spaces are allowed
 in 
\family typewriter
KEYWORDS
\family default
 names or variable values.
 An example is: 
\family typewriter
prior_betas=1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Tables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table variables are used for tabular data series that have multiple values
 in categories.
 Tables are identified by listing the number of rows (
\family typewriter
nrow
\family default
), number of columns (
\family typewriter
ncol
\family default
), and providing the keyword 
\family typewriter
columnlabels
\family default
.
 This is followed by 
\family typewriter
nrow
\family default
 rows of data, with values arranged in 
\family typewriter
ncol
\family default
 columns, corresponding to the same order as the 
\family typewriter
columnlabels
\family default
, and delimited by one or more spaces.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
BEGIN Q_compression_cv TABLE
\family default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
nrow=2 ncol=5 columnlabels 
\family default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
BetaAssoc Toep_flag Nrow Ncol Nlay 
\family default

\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter

\family default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
END Q_compression_cv
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Files 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A user may want to shorten the length of the main input file by reading
 certain input from external text files.
 This can be done by signaling an input block with the word 
\family typewriter
FILES
\family default
, to read a file containing the entire set of information for the block.
 Regardless of whether the external text file contains a 
\family typewriter
KEYWORDS
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
TABLE
\family default
 block, a block definition must be in place directing the program to the
 external file.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
BEGIN Q_compression_cv FILE 
\family default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
compression.txt
\family default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
END Q_compression_cv
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this example, the contents of the file compression.txt would be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter

\family default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline

\begin_layout Subsection
bgaPEST Input Blocks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The specific input blocks used in bgaPEST are discussed, in order of appearance
 in the 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Formula $<$
\end_inset

casename
\begin_inset Formula $>$
\end_inset

.bgp
\family default
 file.
 The order of the blocks is important to maintain in the order discussed
 in this report.
 For each block, data types are identified either as 
\emph on
float
\emph default
, 
\emph on
integer
\emph default
, or 
\emph on
string
\emph default
.
 Values entered as 
\emph on
float
\emph default
 can include scientific/engineering notation, but in all cases should contain
 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 even if no fractional detail is included.
 Conversely, 
\emph on
integers
\emph default
 must not contain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Variables identified as 
\emph on
string
\emph default
 may not include spaces because whitespace is used as the delimiter for
 rows in tables and separating keywords.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each block is also defined with a suffix of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cv
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

control variables,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for data.
 Control variables are those that govern the behavior of the algorithm as
 a whole as opposed to data points (such as parameter values, structural
 parameter values, etc.).

\family default
 run through, for example, a Python script.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The posterior covariance matrix may take two forms: a full matrix; or a

 These options are discussed below.
 Two options are available for Jacobian sensitivity matrices

 The first two indicate the number of rows (

\family default
) in the following matrix.
 The next integer (named

\family default
) is a code, the role of which will be discussed shortly.
 Following the header line is the matrix itself, in which entries are space-sepa
rated and wrapped to the next line if appropriate.
 The maximum line length is 500 characters, so wrapping to the next line
 must occur within 500 characters.
 It is recommended to wrap lines after 8 values and to maintain maximum
 possible precision.

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Forward Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The forward model must exist and have the ability--either inherently or
 through pre- and post-processing--to receive input and provide output using
 text (ascii) files.
 For bgaPEST to be able to run the model, template files (
\family typewriter
.TPL
\family default
) and instruction files (
\family typewriter
.INS
\family default
) must be provided corresponding with model input and output, respectively.
 Details of the contruction of these files are in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "chapter 3"
key "PEST"

\end_inset

.
 The template and instruction files are detailed in the 
\family typewriter
model_input_files
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
model_output_files 
\family default
blocks, respectively.
 The 
\family typewriter
model_command_lines
\family default
 block must also be included with an entry for either a batch file or shell
 script in the 
\family typewriter
command
\family default
 keyword that runs the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Observations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
observation_groups
\family default
 block must be completed.
 All observations can belong to the same group if desired.
 Groups are reported in output to assist in interpretation of results.
 The 
\family typewriter
observation_data
\family default
 block must also be completed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Beta Associations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beta associations are first defined in the 
\family typewriter
prior_mean_data
\family default
 block.
 If no prior information about mean values and their covariance is to be
 supplied, the only information necessary is a row for each beta association
 in the 
\family typewriter
prior_mean_data
\family default
 block and a decision about whether to transform the value with a logarithmic
 transform or not.
 Note that beta associations indicate regions and groups that will have
 the same mean value estimated regardless of whether prior information about
 the mean is provided or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Structural Parameters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each beta association must have a variogram specified for it, defined by
 structural parameters.
 Therefore, the 
\family typewriter
structural_parameters_cv
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
structural_parameter_data
\family default
 blocks must be completed.
 Whether or not to optimize for structural parameter values, and whether
 or not to provide prior information about the values is optional.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Parameters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
parameter_groups
\family default
 block must be completed and, like with observations, it is acceptable for
 all parameters to be in a single group, and groups do not need to correspond
 with beta associations.
 The 
\family typewriter
parameter_cv
\family default
 keyword 
\family typewriter
ndim
\family default
 must be provided, and the 
\family typewriter
parameter_data
\family default
 block must be completed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Algorithmic Control Variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
algorithmic_cv
\family default
 block contains variables that all have default values.
 However, bgaPEST must find the 
\family typewriter
algorithmic_cv
\family default
 block - even if it is empty.
 If the 
\family typewriter
algorithmic_cv
\family default
 block is empty, all default values will be used.

 over successive iterations.
 It is recommended to limit the number of linesearch iterations to a relatively
 low number, as the goal of handling weak linearity is balanced against
 the computations required to perform the line search.
 The greatest advantage is likely achieved in the first few (less than five)
 iterations.
 The role of the line search is not to find a minimum value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi$
\end_inset

 because the nonlinearity of the overall problem prevents it.
 Rather, the line search is meant to be a correction of search direction
 for stability.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In distributed parameter fields, such as hydraulic conductivity in groundwater
 models, it is common to encounter anisotropy along an axis that may or
 not be aligned with the coordinate (x, y, z) axes.
 bgaPEST allows the definition of anisotropy in a horizontal plane at any
 angle from the x-axis and also in the vertical direction.
 The general layout of horizontal anisotropy is illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:anisotropy"

\end_inset

.
 The angle from the x-axis (specified in degrees) is defined by 
\family typewriter
horiz_angle
\family default
 and the amount of anisotropy is defined by 
\family typewriter
horiz_ratio
\family default
.
 
\family typewriter
p_max
\family default
 refers to the direction with maximum parameter values and 
\family typewriter
p_min
\family default
 refers to the direction of minimum parameter values.
 The ratio is used to adjust the effective distance (and thereby the covariance
 values) along that principal direction.
 The user supplies values for 
\family typewriter
horiz_angle
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
horiz_ratio

 for each beta association.
 If some beta associations are not meant to exhibit anisotropy, the user
 may simply set

 If none of the beta associations exhibit anisotropy, the entire 
\family typewriter

\begin_layout Subsection
Prior Covariance Matrix Storage Issues
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In underdetermined problems suitable for bgaPEST, the number of parameters
 can be very large.
 The prior covariance matrix discussed above can, therefore, grow to such
 large dimensions that it cannot be practically stored in computer memory.
 However, two techniques are provided to alleviate some of this storage
 stress: compression and Toeplitz transformation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compression takes advantage of the fact that values in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{G_{ss}}$
\end_inset

 matrix relating parameters in different beta associations, by definition,
 have the value of zero.
 As a result, a general 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{G_{ss}}$
\end_inset

 matrix can be viewed as a partitioned matrix of nonzero blocks 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{ss},\beta i}\right)$
\end_inset

 and zero blocks 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{ss}}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{ss},\beta1} & \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0}\\
\mathbf{0} & \mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{ss},\beta2} & \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0}\\
\mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & \ddots & \mathbf{0}\\
\mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{ss},\beta p}
\end{array}\right].
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is no need to store the zero elements provided that accommodations
 are made to avoid multiplications that involve the zeros.
 These accommodations have been made in bgaPEST and compression is, therefore,
 allowed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In cases where spacial spacing is constant in respective directions, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{ss},\beta i}$
\end_inset

 is a block Toeplitz matrix 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

.
 A square, symmetric 
\begin_inset Formula $j\times j$

\begin_inset Formula 
\[

t_{0} & t_{1} & \dots\  & t_{j-2} & t_{j-1}\\
t_{1} & t_{0} & t_{1} & \ddots\  & t_{j-2}\\
\vdots\  & t_{1} & t_{0} & \ddots\  & \vdots\\
t_{j-2} & \ddots\  & \ddots\  & \ddots\  & t_{1}\\
t_{j-1} & t_{j-2} & \dots\  & t_{1} & t_{0}
\end{array}\right]}}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This matrix has the properties that there are only 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 unique values, and these values occur in a regular order such that only
 a vector of length 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 needs to be stored from which individual rows can be constructed to perform
 matrix multiplication operations.
 The spacing, as indicated above, must be constant.
 For example, in a spatial model such as properties in a groundwater model,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x,$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta y,$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta z$
\end_inset

 must be constant, but these values do not need to be equal to each other.
 While this is restrictive in the sense that it implies a regular grid that
 may not correspond to geometry in the field.
 However, the regular grid required to take advantage of Toeplitz storage
 and operations can be assigned to one beta association with a surrounding,
 irregular grid put in another beta association with fewer parameter values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to use Toeplitz structure in three dimensions, there must be a
 three-level embedding of Toeplitz matrices 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The first level corresponds to the model layers, the second level corresponds
 to model rows, and the third level corresponds to model columns.
 Inspection of the schematic example in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:toep"

\end_inset

 shows that every distinct value represented in the entire matrix is found
 in the first (leftmost) column.
 Cycling of rows or columns, relative to the single stored vector, can be
 used to reconstruct any row or column of the main matrix to be used in
 multiplication operations.
 In bgaPEST, a combination of Toeplitz and complete blocks can make up the
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{G_{ss}}$
\end_inset

 matrix in Compressed form, as discussed above.

Implementation of Partitions into Beta Associations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concept of beta associations is discussed above and details of their
 implementation are explained here.
 First, the prior covariance matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Q_{ss}}$
\end_inset

 is censored by assigning a value of zero to each element which characterizes
 covariance between cells of different regions or parameter types, as defined
 by beta associations.
 It is not required that the covariance model be the same for each beta
 association.
 If different covariance models are used for different zones, this is reflected
 in the appropriate parts of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Q_{ss}}.$
\end_inset

 Furthermore, in some applications, a single structural parameter, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta,$
\end_inset

 may be estimated and applied to all of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Q_{ss}.}$
\end_inset

 In other cases, and necessarily if the covariance model differs in various
 beta association, multiple elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\theta}$
\end_inset

 are estimated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A distinct prior mean parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\beta^{*}}$
\end_inset

 is assigned for each beta association, and the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}$
\end_inset

 (Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Es"

\end_inset

) is determined as explained in above.
 In cases where the mean of each zone is completely unknown, no values for
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\beta^{*}}$
\end_inset

 are provided, but the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}$
\end_inset

 matrix is constructed nonetheless and in both cases a value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\hat{\beta}}$
\end_inset

 is calculated for each beta association.

Structural Parameters and Restricted Maximum Likelihood
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A vital element to the method outlined above is proper selection of the
 structural parameters.
 Structural parameters--also called hyperparameters--or nuisance parameters,
 are the parameters that characterize the covariance structure of both the
 epistemic uncertainty related to the observations, and the inherent variability
 of the parameters.
 In this work, structural parameters may include the epistemic uncertainty
 term in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:R"

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\sigma_{R}^{2}\right)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\left(\theta\right).$

 Appropriately, the most structure expressed in the parameter field, and
 the correspondingly lowest residuals, are found in the vicinity of the
 pumping well where the greatest stress (and therefore the greatest amount

 This phenomenon is discussed in further detail by

Three Layer Example Application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A three layer groundwater model is presented to explore the use of multiple
 beta associations, anisotropy, and a larger number of parameters.
 In this case, the model is 40 rows by 35 columns across three layers.
 The row spacing is 2.0 m while the column spacing is 1.5 m.
 The layers, from shallowest to deepest, are 1.8 m, 1.4 m, and 1.8 m in thickness,
 respectively.
 The disparate row, column, and layer spacing was used to test the Toeplitz
 compression option.
 The model has constant head boundaries on all sides (set at the same elevation-
-60 meters) and a single well at row 18, column 17, extracting at 0.01 liters/min
ute from each layer.
 This low flow rate is not meant to represent typical field conditions,
 but rather highlights what can be learned with even a very small stress
 on the system.

 of roughness of the solution) can be influenced by adjusting the epistemic
 uncertainty term 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\sigma_{R}^{2}\right)$
\end_inset

, so in these cases, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

 is set at a fixed value.
 In Case 3, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

 is set low 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1.0\times10^{-5}\right)$
\end_inset

 and the restricted maximum likelihood algorithm is given the freedom to
 estimate it.
 This is to illustrate the best achievable fit that one might achieve given
 the specific observation set provided without regard for overfitting.
 In Cases 5 and 6, estimates are made with specification of anisotropy in
 the prior covariance.
 Inspection of the true parameter field in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "3Ltruek"

\end_inset

 suggests a possible correlation along the horizontal axis, indicative of
 a channel feature.
 In Cases 5 and 6, therefore, an arbitrarily chosen ratio of 100 is applied
 with a rotation angle of zero.
 In Case 5, like in Case 3, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

 is estimated to achieve the best possible fit, while in Case 6, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

 is held constant at 
\begin_inset Formula $1.0\times10^{-1}.$

 In this case, the value of

 is set at a very low value 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1.0\times10^{-4}\right)$

 to attempt to achieve excellent fit while introducing anisotropy with the
 principal direction aligned with the horizontal axis.
 In layer 1, a somewhat spurious artifact is found in the form of a high
 hydraulic conductivity zone near the middle of the field.
 The head targets almost match within machine precision, however, and all
 other features are reasonable.
 This highlights the fact that, within a single beta association, if anisotropy
 is used, 
\emph on
all 
\emph default
features estimated will roughly correspond to that framework so, in a Bayesian
 sense, the answer is 
\emph on
conditional 
\emph default
on the prior assumption that the anisotropy is an appropriate general characteri
stic shape of the parameter field.
 Such assumptions must be made cautiously.

 is set at a the same value as Case 1

 Since anisotropy is a reasonable characteristic of the

 field in this case, better fits are achieved (nearly an order of magnitude
 lower residuals) and the general pattern of the parameter field is better
 in Case 6 using anisotropy than in Case 1 without anisotropy.
 This highlights the power that anisotropy can bring to a parameter estimation
 problem when it is appropriate even when 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{R}^{2}$

 is set conservatively to avoid overfitting.
 As discussed above, however, this will, in a sense, force the solution
 to conform to such a shape, so it's use should be approached with caution.

 Reverse flood routing is useful to obtain hydrographs in upstream ungauged

 corrupted with multiplicative random errors and used in the inverse procedure.
 The simulation time was equal to 15 hours; the input and output hydrograph
 time discretization was constant and equal to 5 minutes resulting in 181
 values.
 The initial flow condition and the downstream discharge time series (181
 observations) were then used to estimate the inflow hydrograph (181 parameters).
 The initial parameter values were set to the mean value of the observations.
 The sensitivity (Jacobian) matrix was evaluated by means of a finite difference
 calculations using the python linkage and PEST, as capable in the released
 version of bgaPEST.
 The epistemic error term 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and the linear variogram slope parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 were estimated by the restricted maximum likelihood value algorithm.

\begin_layout Standard
In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 the actual input hydrograph, the actual downstream hydrograph, assessed
 by applying the forward model, and the error corrupted one used for the
 inversion are reported along with the reproduced inflow and the corresponding
 outflow.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 summarizes the estimated structural parameters.
 In the first case the downstream hydrograph was corrupted with a 1% multiplicat
ive random error (Figure

a), in the second case a 10% multiplicative random error was used (Figure

\end_inset

b).
 In both the inversions, there is a good match between the estimated input
 hydrograph and the actual one; the peak discharge and time are properly
 reproduced.
 The estimated epistemic error variance increases in the second case taking
 account of the higher erroneous observations (Table
