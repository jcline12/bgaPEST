   abstract = {Bioremediation has been argued to be one of the most cost-effective remediation technologies available to reduce soil, sediment, or groundwater contamination, particularly because this approach may allow for the implementation of in-place strategies. Recent trends have advocated the application of innovative sediment stabilization strategies through placement of (reactive) capping material to allow long-term biodegradation of contaminants in these complex biogeochemical environments. The potential long-term risk reduction associated with this approach requires a demonstration of causal relationships between sediment or contaminant stability on the one hand, and microbial reactivity on the other. The spatial analysis needed to fully understand and quantify these correlations requires sensitive probabilistic techniques. Geostatistics has been used for the characterization of multi-scale spatial patterns for the last few decades, and the analysis of microbial attributes has shown significant spatial structures on microbial abundance and activity. However, there is a dearth of information on the applicability of geostatistics to quantitatively describe the interaction between the microorganisms and their environment. Using the Passaic River (NJ) dioxin data as a model dataset, multiple scaling models were applied to scale and interpolate sampled dioxin data and derive dechlorination signatures in sediments. Unlike conventional geostatistic tools that are based on the point-to-point spatial structures, the new multi-scale model (M-Scale) introduces a new framework for spatial analysis in which regional values at different scales are anchored by the correlations to each other. Spatial dioxin distributions and microbial dechlorination signatures were used as benchmarks for comparison of M-Scale to ordinary kriging. The results from cross-validation and jackknifing approaches applied to these datasets were analyzed and compared using Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) plots and reproduction coefficients. These plots indicated that the M-Scale better preserves the local features of hotspots during data interpolation to a basin-wide scale. Current efforts focus on mapping microbial abundance and respiratory competence in the Anacostia River, based on measurements at three different scales. The outcomes of this work will be used to develop an uncertainty-based spatial decision tool for site remediation in this watershed using various capping strategies.},

   abstract = {The inverse problem (also referred to as parameter estimation) consists of evaluating the medium properties ruling the behaviour of a given equation from direct measurements of those properties and of the dependent state variables. The problem becomes ill-posed when the properties vary spatially in an unknown manner, which is often the case when modelling natural processes. A possibility to fight this problem consists of performing stochastic conditional simulations. That is, instead of seeking a single solution (conditional estimation), one obtains an ensemble of fields, all of which honour the small scale variability (high frequency fluctuations) and direct measurements. The high frequency component of the field is different from one simulation to another, but a fixed component for all of them. Measurements of the dependent state variables are honoured by framing simulation as an inverse problem, where both model fit and parameter plausibility are maximized with respect to the coefficients of the basis functions (pilot point values). These coefficients (model parameters) are used for parameterizing the large scale variability patterns. The pilot points method, which is often used in hydrogeology, uses the kriging weights as basis functions. The performance of the method (both its variants of conditional estimation/simulation) is tested on a synthetic example using a parabolic-type equation. Results show that including the plausibility term improves the identification of the spatial variability of the unknown field function and that the weight assigned to the plausibility term does lead to optimal results both for conditional estimation and for stochastic simulations.

   abstract = {The pilot points method is often used in nonlinear geostatistical calibration. The method consists of estimating the values of the hydraulic properties at a set of arbitrary (pilot) points so as to best fit the aquifer response as measured by available indirect observations (i.e., heads or drawdowns). Though this method remains general and appealing, no prior information of the hydraulic properties is usually included in the optimization process, which constrains the number of pilot points to ensure stability. In this paper, we present a modification of the pilot points method, including prior information in the optimization process by adding a plausibility term to the objective function to be minimized. This results from formulating the inverse problem in a maximum likelihood framework. The performance of the method is tested on a synthetic example. Results show that including the plausibility term improves the identification of heterogeneity. Furthermore, this term makes the inverse problem more stable-and allows the use of larger number of pilot points, thus improving the identification of the heterogeneity as well. Therefore, the use of the plausibility term is recommended. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Small scale variability of hydraulic conductivity controls groundwater contaminant transport and some of the subtle aspects of transport through heterogeneous media (e.g., mixing and tailing). Unfortunately, it cannot be identified. This paper addresses the question of whether the presence of high frequency fluctuations, which define small scale variability, impedes the characterization of large scale variability patterns. In parallel, we investigate whether including small scale variability allows us to reproduce tailing in breakthrough curves. To this end, we solve the inverse problem using the regularized pilot points method for simulating fields of hydraulic conductivity conditioned to available information. Heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity is represented by two nested variograms simulating small scale (short range variogram) and large scale (long range) variability patterns. Calibrated fields are applied to the prediction of a transport problem. Application to four synthetic examples (with varying importance of the small scale variability) shows that, first, the calibrations reproduce the statistics of the "true" fields and, second, that a good characterization of the small scale variability is not critical for groundwater flow modeling. More important, small scale variability leads to increased tailing in solute breakthrough curves and needs to be acknowledged for proper transport prediction, which is rarely the case in aquifer modeling practice.

   abstract = {An investigation is conducted to evaluate the hydrogeology of a portion of the Henderson Gneiss near Hendersonville, North Carolina in the Piedmont Physiographic Provence. Geological information is collected from surface outcrops, bedrock cores, and boring logs. There are 25 monitoring wells used to obtain hydrogeological data, with 16 of the observation wells monitored during a constant pumping rate aquifer test. The Henderson Gneiss is a quartz feldspar biotite gneiss which was sheared, on the western edge, during the Alleghanian movement of the adjacent Brevard fault zone. In the study area, the shearing created a C-plane foliation with an average orientation of S40 degrees W 17 degrees SE. The three major fracture sets in this portion of the Henderson Gneiss are a set subparallel to the foliation and two dispersed near orthogonal joint sets with mean orientation of S30 degrees W 78 degrees NW and S68 degrees E 88 degrees SW. The discrete and equivalent porous medium models for evaluating a fractured crystalline rock aquifer are examined. The lack of detailed knowledge of the fracture size, orientation, and interconnection needed for the discrete model makes this model impractical at the aquifer test site. The conditions for a fractured crystalline rock aquifer to behave as a porous medium is discussed. Porous medium equivalence allows the use of mathematical models developed for granular porous aquifers. Analysis of the time-drawdowm data for the bedrock observation wells indicates radial flow behavior followed at late time by a change in the hydraulic properties due to lateral heterogeneities. A 1.5 meter thick foliation-subparallel fracture zone screened by the bedrock wells dominates the flow to the pumping well during the constant discharge aquifer test. The fracture zone has a maximum hydraulic conductivity of 3.73X10 (super -2) cm/sec and a minimum hydraulic conductivity of 5.91X10 (super -3) cm/sec with the major conductivity axis oriented N23 degrees E-S23 degrees W. The coefficient of storage is 9.70X10 (super -5) .},

   abstract = {Data collection is a critical activity in the management of water systems because it supports informed decision making. Data are collected by means of monitoring networks in which water level gauges are of particular interest because of their implications for flood management. This paper introduces a number of modifications to previously published methods that use information theory to design hydrological monitoring networks in order to make the methods applicable to the design of water level monitors for highly controlled polder systems. The new contributions include the use of a hydrodynamic model for entropy analysis, the introduction of the quantization concept to filter out noisy time series, and the use of total correlation to evaluate the performance of three different pairwise dependence criteria. The resulting approach, water level monitoring design in polders (WMP), is applied to a polder in the Pijnacker region, Netherlands. Results show that relatively few monitors are adequate to collect the information of a polder area in spite of its large number of target water levels. It is found, in addition, that the directional information transfer DITYX is more effective in finding independent monitors, whereas DITXY is better for locating sets of monitors with high joint information content. WMP proves to be a suitable and simple method as part of the design of monitoring networks for polder systems.},

The dynamic interchange between groundwater and surface water in the Trout Lake basin was evaluated with the help of a three-dimensional numerical model of the groundwater flow system. The sensitivity of the hydrological system to the possible effects of global climate change were simulated by introducing changes in both precipitation and groundwater recharge. Results show that the hydrological budget of some lakes would be significantly altered; changes in lake level are predicted to be more pronounced for lakes that are located topographically high in the watershed.

   abstract = {In a typical ground water flow model, lakes are represented by specified head nodes requiring that lake levels be known a priori. To remove this limitation, previous researchers assigned high hydraulic conductivity (K) values to nodes that represent a lake, under the assumption that the simulated head at the nodes in the high-K zone accurately reflects lake level. The solution should also produce a constant water level across the lake. We developed a model of a simple hypothetical ground water/lake system to test whether solutions using high-K lake nodes are sensitive to the value of K selected to represent the lake. Results show that the larger the contrast between the K of the aquifer and the K of the lake nodes, the smaller the error tolerance required for the solution to converge. For our test problem, a contrast of three orders of magnitude produced a head difference across the lake of 0.005 m under a regional gradient of the order of 10(-3) m/m, while a contrast of four orders of magnitude produced a head difference of 0.001 m. The high-K method was then used to simulate lake levels in Pretty Lake, Wisconsin. Results for both the hypothetical system and the application to Pretty Lake compared favorably with results using a lake package developed for MODFLOW (Merritt and Konikow 2000). While our results demonstrate that the high-K method accurately simulates lake levels, this method has more cumbersome postprocessing and longer run times than the same problem simulated using the lake package.},

   abstract = {In this study, we formulate a contaminant source characterization problem as a nonlinear optimization model, in which contaminant source locations and release histories are defined as explicit unknown variables. The optimization model selected is the standard model, in which the residuals between the simulated and measured contaminant concentrations at observation sites are minimized. In the proposed formulation, simulated concentrations at the observation locations are implicitly embedded into the optimization model through the solution of ground-water flow and contaminant fate and transport simulation models. It is well known that repeated solutions of these models, which is a necessary component of the optimization process, dominate the computational cost and adversely affect the efficiency of this approach. To simplify this computationally intensive process, a new combinatorial approach, identified as the progressive genetic algorithm, is proposed for the solution of the nonlinear optimization model. Numerical experiments show that the proposed approach provides a robust tool for the solution of ground-water contaminant source identification problems.},

   abstract = {A new theory is presented for groundwater flow in layered, anisotropic aquifers; flow must remain semi-confined. Two main approximations are made: (1) the aquifer consists of a number of horizontal, homogeneous layers, each with its own anisotropic transmissivity, and (2) the resistance to flow in the vertical direction is neglected. Analytic solutions are derived for the head and horizontal flow in each layer by use of a comprehensive transmissivity tensor. The vertical component of flow at the layer interfaces is computed analytically by vertical integration of the horizontal divergence. The theory is applied to both uniform flow and flow to a well; solutions may be superimposed. Flow in layered, anisotropic aquifers is three-dimensional when the anisotropy between layers differs. In the context of contaminant transport, the resulting three-dimensional flow field can be of great importance. Three-dimensional flow lines become especially complicated near pumping wells. In a two-layer aquifer, the flow lines to a well may be grouped into four bundles of spiraling flow lines, referred to as groundwater whirls. These whirls are bounded by two vertical planes that intersect at the well; horizontal flow along these planes is radial. For a well in a uniform flow field, the complications of the three-dimensional flow field are illustrated by the difficulties that are encountered in delineating the capture zone of the well.},

   abstract = {We present a new stable gravity inversion method applied to the mapping of an interface separating two homogeneous media. In contrast with previous similar methods, it does not impose an overall smoothness on the estimated interface to stabilize the solution. The density contrast between the media is assumed to be known. The interpretation model for the upper medium consists of rectangular juxtaposed prisms whose thicknesses represent the depths to the interface and are the parameters to be estimated. The true interface is assumed to be flat everywhere except at faults. To incorporate this attribute into the estimated relief, we developed an iterative process in which three kinds of constraints are imposed on parameters: (1) proximity between values of adjacent parameters, (2) lower and upper bounds to parameters, and (3) proximity between the values of parameters and fixed numerical values. Starting with an initial solution which presents an overall smooth relief, the method enhances initially estimated geometric features of the interface; that is, flat areas will tend to become flatter and steep areas will tend to become steeper. This is accomplished by weighting the constraints, which requires proximity between adjacent parameters. The weights are initialized with values equal to unity and are updated automatically to enhance any discrepancy between adjacent depths that have been detected at the initial solution. Constraints 2 and 3 are used both to compensate for the decrease in solution stability caused by the introduction of small weights and to reinforce flatness at the basin bottom. Constraint 2 imposes that any depth be nonnegative and smaller than an a priori known maximum depth value, whereas constraint 3 imposes that all depths be closest to a value greater than the maximum depth. The trade-off between these conflicting constraints is attained with a final relief presenting flat bottom and steep borders. The method was tested with a synthetic gravity anomaly produced by a simulated sedimentary cratonix extensional basin whose basement consists of steep edges and a flat bottom. The results showed an improvement in the resolution of the relief, leading to a reliable mapping both of the sharp discontinuities at the borders and of the lateral extent of the base of the basin. Additionally, the method produced excellent estimates for the average dip angles of the basin edges (presumably controlled by normal faults), indicating, in this way, its potential in interpreting data produced by this kind of basin. The method was applied to the Bouguer anomaly from the northern portion of Steptoe Valley, Nevada, delineating an isolated basin with a wider, flat base and relatively straight borders as compared with the estimate imposing overall smoothness on the relief.},

Head, flow, and conservative- and virus-transport observations are considered. The paper examines the use of (1) observed-value weighting, (2) breakthrough-curve temporal moment observations, and (3) the significance of changes in the transport time-step size. The results suggest that (1) sensitivities using observed-value weighting are more susceptible to numerical solution variability, (2) temporal moments of the breakthrough curve are a more robust measure of sensitivity than individual conservative-transport observations, and (3) the transport-simulation time step size is more important than the inactivation rate in solution and about as important as at least two other parameters, reflecting the ease with which results can be influenced by numerical issues. The approach presented allows more accurate evaluation of the information provided by observations for estimation of parameters and generally improves the potential for reasonable parameter-estimation results.

The first three parameters relate to subsurface transport in general while the last four, the sorption rate, distribution coefficient, and in-solution and adsorbed inactivation rates, represent the interaction of viruses with the porous medium and their ability to persist. The importance of four types of observations to estimate the virus-transport parameters are evaluated: hydraulic heads, flow, temporal moments of conservative-transport concentrations, and virus concentrations. The evaluations are conducted using one- and two-dimensional homogeneous simulations, designed from published field experiments, and recently developed sensitivity-analysis methods. Sensitivity to the transport-simulation time-step size is used to evaluate the importance of numerical solution difficulties. Results suggest that hydraulic conductivity, porosity, and sorption are most important to virus-transport predictions. Most observation types provide substantial information about hydraulic conductivity and porosity; only virus-concentration observations provide information about sorption and inactivation. The observations are not sufficient to estimate these important parameters uniquely. Even with all observation types, there is extreme parameter correlation between porosity and hydraulic conductivity and between the sorption rate and insolution inactivation. Parameter estimation was accomplished by fixing values of porosity and insolution inactivation. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

   journal = {Water Resources Research},
   volume = {37},
   number = {1},
   pages = {21-31},
   abstract = {Tracer experiments provide information about aquifer material properties vital for accurate site characterization. Unfortunately, density-induced sinking can distort tracer movement, leading to an inaccurate assessment of material properties. Yet existing criteria for selecting appropriate tracer concentrations are based on analysis of homogeneous media instead of media with heterogeneities typical of held sites. This work introduces a hydraulic-gradient correction for heterogeneous media and applies it to a criterion previously used to indicate density-induced instabilities in homogeneous media. The modified criterion was tested using a series of two-dimensional heterogeneous intermediate-scale tracer experiments and data from several detailed field tracer tests. The intermediate-scale experimental facility (10.0 x 1.2 x 0.06 m) included both homogeneous and heterogeneous (sigma (2)(1nk) =1.22) zones. The held tracer tests were less heterogeneous (0.24 < <sigma>(2)(1n k) < 0.37), but measurements were sufficient to detect density-induced sinking. Evaluation of the modified criterion using the experiments and field tests demonstrates that the new criterion appears to account for the change in density-induced sinking due to heterogeneity. The criterion demonstrates the importance of accounting for heterogeneity to predict density-induced sinking and differences in the onset of density-induced sinking in two- and three-dimensional systems.},

   abstract = {Fractures, which are common structural heterogeneities in geological folds and domes, impact the charge, seal, and trapping potential of hydrocarbon reservoirs. Because of their effects on reservoir quality, the numerical prediction of fractures has recently been the focus of petroleum geoscientists. A horizon's curvature is commonly used to infer the state of deformation in those strata. It is assumed that areas of elevated calculated curvatures underwent elevated deformation, resulting in a concentration of fractures and faults there. Usually, curvatures are calculated from spatial data after sampling the continuous horizon at discrete points. This sampled geometry of the horizon includes surface undulations of all scales, which are then also included in the calculated curvatures. Including surface undulations of all scales in the curvature analysis leads to noisy and questionable results. We argue that the source data must be filtered prior to curvature analysis to separate different spatial scales of surface undulations, such as broad structures, faults, and sedimentary features. Only those surface undulations that scale with the problem under consideration should then be used in a curvature analysis. For the scale-dependent decomposition of spatial data, we test the suitability of four numerical techniques (Fourier [spectral] analysis, wavelet transform filtering, singular value decomposition, factorial kriging) on a seismically mapped horizon in the North Sea. For surfaces sampled over a regular grid (e.g., seismic data), Fourier (spectral) analysis extracts meaningful curvatures on the scale of broad horizon features, such as structural domes and basins.

Nonlinear sorption is modeled by means of different isotherm equations including the commonly used Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms, but also the Langmuir-Freundlich, Toth, and two-site Langmuir isotherms. Evaluation of cleanup times, defined as the times required to reduce the concentration to a given fraction of its initial value, for different isotherms and combinations of input parameters demonstrate the effects of the properties of the isotherms. In particular, the asymptotic behavior as the aqueous concentration approaches zero is important for transport predictions, where Freundlich sorption leads to infinitely increasing cleanup times as the initial plume concentration decreases. The effect of the choice of sorption isotherm, evaluated by using ''best-fit'' parameters for four different isotherms, is found to be large and dependent on heterogeneity for the particular data set considered.},

In the last five years, MCMC has been introduced into significance testing, general Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood estimation. This paper presents basic methodology of MCMC, emphasizing the Bayesian paradigm, conditional probability and the intimate relationship with Markov random fields in spatial statistics. Hastings algorithms are discussed, including Gibbs, Metropolis and some other variations. Pairwise difference priors are described and are used subsequently in three Bayesian applications, in each of which there is a pronounced spatial or temporal aspect to the modeling. The examples involve logistic regression in the presence of unobserved covariates and ordinal factors; the analysis of agricultural field experiments, with adjustment for fertility gradients; and processing of low-resolution medical images obtained by a gamma camera. Additional methodological issues arise in each of these applications and in the Appendices. The paper lays particular emphasis on the calculation of posterior probabilities and concurs with others in its view that MCMC facilitates a fundamental breakthrough in applied Bayesian modeling.},

Through appropriate petrophysical relationships, these tools offer data suitable for parameterising and constraining models of groundwater flow. This is demonstrated using cross-borehole radar and resistivity measurements collected during a controlled vadose zone tracer test, performed at a field site in the UK Sherwood Sandstone. Both methods show clearly the vertical migration of the tracer over a 200 h monitoring period. By comparing first and second spatial moments of changes in moisture content predicted from a numerical simulation of vadose zone flow with equivalent statistics from two- and three-dimensional ERT and cross-borehole radar profiles the effective hydraulic conductivity is estimated to be approximately 0.4 m/d. Such a value is comparable to field estimates from borehole hydraulic tests carried out in the saturated zone at the field site and provides valuable information that may be utilised to parameterise pollutant transport models of the site.

In contrast to deep rock formations with tight, almost impermeable matrix rock, we consider fractures embedded in permeable rock blocks. It is shown that in many cases (e.g. in sandstone formations) the advective transport of contaminants in permeable blocks can be identified as the major process leading to contaminant exchange between fractures and blocks. In the framework of the present study, a simplified conceptual model of the fractured formation is adopted. The conceptual model is formulated by sets of space linear differential equations subject to time dependent boundary conditions. A closed form analytical solution of these sets of differential equations is developed. Calculations of the contaminant distribution along the fracture network are utilized to obtain breakthrough curves concerning the time variation of the average contaminant concentration in certain cross sections of the fractured permeable medium. Characteristics of the contaminant transport phenomena originating from the contaminant advection and the mixing between the fracture flow and the permeable block flow are determined, and possibilities of considering the fractured permeable formation as a continuum are discussed.},

It was shown that advective movements in the fracture flow and the permeable block flow, as well as mixing between these two types of flow, are the most significant factors affecting contaminant transport and spreading in such formations. The basic formulation and the closed form analytical solution developed in paper I invite the use of numerical schemes for a further analysis of the contaminant transport processes. In the framework of the present paper this target is achieved. A numerical solution scheme stemming from the conceptual model of paper I is developed. Simulations are performed by considering the various properties of the discrete fracture flow and the permeable block flow. The results of the present study indicate that fractured permeable formations can be represented by single continuum models provided that a sufficiently large number of sectors is included in the representative elementary volume (REV). The minimum number of sectors depends on the ratio between the specific discharge of the permeable block flow and that imposed by the fracture presence. This ratio is named the mobility number. The larger the mobility number the smaller the number of sectors which should be incorporated in the REV. Equivalent properties of the continuum representing the fractured permeable formation, such as the equivalent porosity and dispersivity, are determined and evaluated.},

   abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the exponential growth in the amount of data that one may expect to provide greater modeling and predictions opportunities, the number and diversity of sources over which this information is fragmented is growing at an even faster rate. As a consequence, there is real need for methods that aim at reconciling them inside an epistemically sound theoretical framework. In a statistical spatial prediction framework, classical methods are based on a multivariate approach of the problem, at the price of strong modeling hypotheses. Though new avenues have been recently opened by focusing on the integration of uncertain data sources, to the best of our knowledges there have been no systematic attemps to explicitly account for information redundancy through a data fusion procedure. Starting from the simple concept of measurement errors, this paper proposes an approach for integrating multiple information processing as a part of the prediction process itself through a Bayesian approach. A general formulation is first proposed for deriving the prediction distribution of a continuous variable of interest at unsampled locations using on more or less uncertain (soft) information at neighboring locations. The case of multiple information is then considered, with a Bayesian solution to the problem of fusing multiple information that are provided as separate conditional probability distributions. Well-known methods and results are derived as limit cases. The convenient hypothesis of conditional independence is discussed by the light of information theory and maximum entropy principle, and a methodology is suggested for the optimal selection of the most informative subset of information, if needed. Based on a synthetic case study, an application of the methodology is presented and discussed.},

However, analysis of transient data from such a suite of pumping tests represents a substantial computational burden. Although steady state responses can be analyzed to reduce this computational burden significantly, the time required to reach steady state will often be too long for practical applications of the tomography concept. In addition, uncertainty regarding the mechanisms driving the system to steady state can propagate to adversely impact the resulting hydraulic conductivity estimates. These disadvantages of a steady state analysis can be overcome by exploiting the simplifications possible under the steady shape flow regime. At steady shape conditions, drawdown varies with time but the hydraulic gradient does not. Thus transient data can be analyzed with the computational efficiency of a steady state model. In this study, we demonstrate the value of the steady shape concept for inversion of hydraulic tomography data and investigate its robustness with respect to improperly specified boundary conditions.},

   abstract = {[1] Hydraulic tomography is a promising approach for obtaining information on variations in hydraulic conductivity on the scale of relevance for contaminant transport investigations. This approach involves performing a series of pumping tests in a format similar to tomography. We present a field-scale assessment of hydraulic tomography in a porous aquifer, with an emphasis on the steady shape analysis methodology. The hydraulic conductivity ( K) estimates from steady shape and transient analyses of the tomographic data compare well with those from a tracer test and direct-push permeameter tests, providing a field validation of the method. Zonations based on equal-thickness layers and cross-hole radar surveys are used to regularize the inverse problem. The results indicate that the radar surveys provide some useful information regarding the geometry of the K field. The steady shape analysis provides results similar to the transient analysis at a fraction of the computational burden. This study clearly demonstrates the advantages of hydraulic tomography over conventional pumping tests, which provide only large-scale averages, and small-scale hydraulic tests (e.g., slug tests), which cannot assess strata connectivity and may fail to sample the most important pathways or barriers to flow.},

   abstract = {The information provided by different geophysical data sets (gravimetric, magnetic, seismic, etc.) can be used, together with petrophysical and geostatistical information, to estimate the major lithological properties of the rocks within the studied volume. The formalization of this inverse problem requires a joint representation and parameterization of the different media properties in the model. The information relating rock properties together couples the inversion of the plural geophysical data sets and allows one to relate the observations with the lithological parameters of the model. The representation by probability density functions (pdfs) of the different types of information entering the problem is also required and provides the mathematical framework to formulate their combination. The resulting joint posterior pdf is composed of two factors: the joint likelihood function, which is the product of independent likelihood functions associated with each geophysical data set, and the joint prior pdf. The latter decomposes, following a partition of the model parameter space in a primary (lithological) subspace and secondary (physical) subspace, as a marginal pdf over the primary model parameter space and a conditional pdf over the secondary model parameter space. A Markov-chain Monte Carlo method was adapted to sample joint models from the posterior pdf: (1) the method starts with a Markov-chain sampling primary models from the marginal prior pdf, (2) the chain is extended to the joint model space, by sampling from the conditional pdf of the secondary parameters with respect to the primary parameters, and (3) it is modified to sample from the posterior pdf, by applying the Metropolis rule, which uses the evaluation of the joint likelihood function to accept or reject model transitions in the sampling chain. Finally, posterior marginal or posterior conditional pdfs for the model parameters or the model properties can be straightforwardly calculated from the set of joint models sampled by the chain.},

   pages = {582-662},
   abstract = {A detailed mineral-solute mass-balance spreadsheet model has been developed to improve understanding of mineralogic controls on water composition in surface waters and groundwater systems dominated by silicate lithologies. The spreadsheet-based approach is used to investigate mass-balance solutions over a range of mineral compositions for predominant, multi-element phases such as plagioclase, biotite, chlorite, amphibole, and dioctahedral smectite. The mass-balance technique has been applied to a variety of hydrogeologic environments including calibrated watersheds, springs and groundwater systems. Lithologic settings include plutonic, metamorphic, minor volcanic, and sedimentary (alluvial and glacial deposits) materials. Sites investigated, most of which allowed comparison with earlier work, include ephemeral and perennial springs of the central Sierra Nevada Mountains, California; the Loch Vale, Colorado high-altitude watershed; four catchments in the Inyo Mountains, California and Nevada; watersheds in the Catoctin Mountain, Maryland area; and ground-water How systems in Vekol Valley, Arizona and in the Trout Lake area, Wisconsin. Analytical mass balances were derived with a novel approach that permits graphic analysis of the functional dependency of mineral mass-transfer coefficients on variations in major silicate composition. A 10 x 10 matrix of mineral-solute reaction equations was used to solve for the best mass balances. Alternative methods were developed to investigate cases where the number of mineral phases exceeds the number of solute constraints (10) that are commonly found in clastic, silicate-dominated systems with diverse sources and/or phase mixtures of variable chemistry (such as an assortment of plagioclase compositions). Techniques were also developed to allow for important structurally controlled compositional variation in clay minerals. Final mass-balance choices were tempered by thermodynamic stability calcudations for various minerals under near-surface weathering conditions. Mineral mass-transfer ratios were also found to be useful in restricting mass balances. Additional constraints were provided by establishing consistent sets of similar mineral assemblages and mineral compositions for a series of wells along a ground-water flow path, or through comparison of multiple nearby watersheds subject to similar climatic and vegetative conditions. Whereas unique analytical solutions from spreadsheet mass balances were not always possible, a surprisingly limited range was obtained for mineral assemblages and compositions satisfying observed mineral occurrences and thermodynamic stability conditions. Our results demonstrate the importance of having well-characterized mineral compositions for both reactant and product phases. The mass-balance results are particularly sensitive to the compositions of plagioclase, dioctahedral smectite, and a few primary mafic mineral groups (trioctahedral mica, amphibole, and pyroxene). In addition to mineral controls, the specific examples studied demonstrate effects of dolomite and calcite overprints on silicate weathering, biomass fluctuations, road salt contamination, and on buried evaporite salts. A comparison of the mass-balance results from surface- and groundwater systems indicates strong similarities, suggesting that similar processes dominate the mineral controls in both settings, and that, under soil weathering conditions ion exchange might have been overemphasized, except under conditions where pre-existing waters are displaced by solutions of significantly different composition.},

   abstract = {Environmental regulations on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from corn (Zea mays L.)-ethanol production require accurate assessment methods to determine emissions savings from coproducts that are fed to livestock. We investigated current use of coproducts in livestock diets and estimated the magnitude and variability in the GHG emissions credit for coproducts in the corn-ethanol life cycle. The coproduct GHG emissions credit varied by more than twofold, from 11.5 to 28.3 g CO(2)e per MJ of ethanol produced, depending on the fraction of coproducts used without drying, the proportion of coproduct used to feed beef cattle (Bos taurus) vs. dairy or swine (Sus scrofa), and the location of corn production. Regional variability in the GHG intensity of crop production and future livestock feeding trends will determine the magnitude of the coproduct GHG offset against GHG emissions elsewhere in the corn-ethanol life cycle. Expansion of annual U.S. corn-ethanol production to 57 billion liters by 2015, as mandated in current federal law, will require feeding of coproduct at inclusion levels near the biological limit to the entire U.S. feedlot cattle, dairy, and swine herds. Under this future scenario, the coproduct GHG offset will decrease by 8% from current levels due to expanded use by dairy and swine, which are less efficient in use of coproduct than beef feedlot cattle. Because the coproduct GHG credit represents 19 to 38% of total life cycle GHG emissions, accurate estimation of the coproduct credit is important for determining the net impact of corn-ethanol production on atmospheric warming and whether com-ethanol producers meet state- and national-level GHG emissions regulations.},

   abstract = {Substantial flowpath-related variability of Sr-87/Sr-86 is observed in groundwaters collected from the Trout Lake watershed of northern Wisconsin. In the extensive shallow aquifer composed of sandy glacial outwash, groundwater is recharged either by seepage from lakes or by precipitation that infiltrates the inter-lake uplands. Sr-87/Sr-86 Of groundwater derived mainly as seepage from a precipitation-dominated lake near the head of the watershed decreases with progressive water chemical evolution along its flowpath due primarily to enhanced dissolution of relatively unradiogenic plagioclase. In contrast, Sr-87/Sr-86 Of groundwater derived mainly from precipitation that infiltrates upland areas is substantially greater than that of precipitation collected from the watershed, due to suppression of plagioclase dissolution together with preferential leaching of Sr from radiogenic phases such as K-feldspar and biotite. The results of a column experiment that simulated the effects of changing residence time of water in the aquifer sand indicate that mobile waters obtain relatively unradiogenic Sr, whereas stagnant waters obtain relatively radiogenic Sr. Nearly the entire range of strontium-isotope composition observed in groundwaters from the watershed was measured in the experimental product waters. The constant mobility of water along groundwater recharge flowpaths emanating from the lakes promotes the dissolution of relatively unradiogenic plagioclase, perhaps due to effective dispersal of clay mineral nuclei resulting from dissolution reactions. In contrast, episodic stagnation in the unsaturated zone along the upland recharge flowpaths suppresses plagioclase dissolution, perhaps due to accumulation of clay mineral nuclei on its reactive surfaces. Differences in redox conditions along these contrasting flowpaths probably enhance the observed differences in strontium isotope behavior. This study demonstrates that factors other than the calculated state of mineral saturation must be considered when attempting to simulate chemical evolution along flowpaths, and that reaction models must be able to incorporate changing contributions from reacting minerals in the calculations.},

   abstract = {History matching forms an integral part of the reservoir modeling workflow process. Despite the existence of many history-matching tools, the integration of production data with seismic and geological continuity data remains a challenge. Geostatistical tools now are routinely employed for integrating large-scale seismic and fine-scale well/core data. A general framework for integrating production data with diverse types of geological/structural data is largely lacking. In this paper, we develop a new method for history matching that can account for production data constraint by prior geological data, such as the presence of channels, fractures, or shale lenses. With multiple-point (MP) geostatistics, prior information about geological patterns is carried by training images from which geological structures are borrowed, then anchored to the subsurface data. A simple Markov chain is proposed to iteratively modify the MP geostatistical realizations until history match. The method is simple and general in the sense that the procedure can be applied to a wide variety of geological environments without requiring a modification of the algorithm. The method does not make assumptions on the flow model. Synthetic cases are used to assess the flexibility of the proposed method. (22 Refs.)},

Bioelectricity produces an average of 81% more transportation kilometers and 108% more emissions offsets per unit area of cropland than does cellulosic ethanol.

Here we show the global potential for bioenergy on abandoned agriculture lands to be less than 8% of current primary energy demand, based on historical land use data, satellite-derived land cover data, and global ecosystem modeling. The estimated global area of abandoned agriculture is 385-472 million hectares, or 66-110% of the areas reported in previous preliminary assessments. The area-weighted mean production of above-ground biomass is 4.3 tons ha(-1) Y-1, in contrast to estimates of up to 10 tons ha(-1) Y-1 in previous assessments. The energy content of potential biomass grown on 100% of abandoned agriculture lands is less than 10% of primary energy demand for most nations in North America, Europe, and Asia, but it represents many times the energy demand in some African nations where grasslands are relatively productive and current energy demand is low.},

   journal = {Water Resour. Res.},
   volume = {45},
   abstract = {In many cases, it has been assumed that the variability in hydrologic parameters can be adequately described through a simple geostatistical model with a given variogram. In other cases, variability may be best described as a series of ‚Äújumps‚Äù in parameter behavior, e.g., those that occur at geologic facies contacts. When using indirect measurements such as pump tests to try to map such heterogeneity (during inverse modeling), the resulting images of the subsurface are always affected by the assumptions invoked. In this paper, we discuss inversion for parameter fields where prior information has suggested that major variability can be described by boundaries between geologic units or facies.

   abstract = {Hydraulic tomography is a promising methodology that shows the potential to map subsurface hydraulic properties at an unprecedented level of detail by interpreting a suite of hydraulic tests. In the present work, we apply the hydraulic tomography concept to a Multiple Pulse Multiple Receiver (MPMR) cross-well configuration, which consists of two boreholes subdivided into intervals by packers. A short pressure (or flow) pulse is applied sequentially to all the intervals, and for each perturbation, the transient heads are recorded at the remaining intervals. The resulting tomograms are inverted within the Bayesian framework by using the pilot point approach. In addition to the values of the hydraulic conductivity at the pilot points, we assume that the stochastic parameters of the spatial variability model (the structural parameters) are unknown. Using synthetic two-dimensional and three-dimensional examples, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the MPMR configuration and the inversion procedure for characterizing the spatial variability of the hydraulic conductivity with limited or no prior information. We observed that increasing the number of source points (the locations at which the pulse is alternatively applied) provides more details on the spatial variability and that the parameters of the hydrogeological model of spatial variability are inferred with an acceptable, although variable, level of accuracy. In particular, the theoretical variance of the log conductivity is estimated with large errors, while the estimate of the anisotropic integral scales depends on the distance between the boreholes. Inversion preserves the overall spatial pattern of hydraulic conductivity, although low conductivity values are less connected in the inferred than in the true conductivity fields.},

The difficulties are caused by the combinatorial nature of assigning discrete well locations and the large computational burden required for time-varying operating costs. This study presents a novel algorithm that integrates Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Constrained Differential Dynamic Programming (CDDP) to solve the two interesting problems of groundwater remediation problem. GA can easily incorporate the fixed costs associated with the installation of wells. CDDP is used to handle the problem of time-varying operating costs. A case study that incorporates fixed and time-varying operating costs is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results indicate that the fixed costs can significantly influence the number and locations of wells, and that a notable total cost saving can be realized by applying the novel algorithm.},

   abstract = {[ 1] This paper presents a joint inversion approach for combining crosshole seismic travel time and borehole flowmeter test data to estimate hydrogeological zonation. The approach is applied to a complex, fractured Department of Energy field site located at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, United States. We consider seismic slowness ( the inverse of seismic velocity) and hydrogeological zonation indicators as unknown variables and use a physically based model with unknown parameters to relate the seismic slowness to the zonation indicators. We jointly estimate all the unknown parameters in the model by conditioning them to the crosshole seismic travel times as well as the borehole flowmeter data using a Bayesian model and a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling method. The fracture zonation estimates are qualitatively compared to bromide tracer breakthrough data and to uranium biostimulation experiment results. The comparison suggests that the joint inversion approach adequately estimated the fractured zonation and that the fracture zonation influenced biostimulation efficacy. Our study suggests that the new joint hydrogeophysical inversion approach is flexible and effective for integrating various types of data sets within complex subsurface environments and that seismic travel time data have the potential to provide valuable information about fracture zonation.},

The novelty of this study lies in the use of the fuzzy neural network for the inference of the likelihood function. This allows spatial correlation of lithofacies as well as nonlinear cross correlation between lithofacies and geophysical attributes to be incorporated into lithofacies estimation. The effectiveness of BFNN is demonstrated using synthetic data emulating measurements at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) Site.},

   abstract = {Innovative in situ remediation technologies using injection /extraction well pairs which recirculate partially treated groundwater as a method of increasing overall treatment efficiency have recently been demonstrated. An important parameter in determining overall treatment efficiency is the fraction of flow that recycles between injection and extraction points. Numerical and semi-analytical methods are currently available to determine this parameter and an analytical solution has been presented for a single injection/extraction well pair. In this work, the analytical solution for fraction of recycled flow for a single injection/extraction well pair is extended to multiple co-linear well pairs. In addition, a semi-analytical method is presented which permits direct calculation of fraction recycle for a system of arbitrarily placed injection/extraction wells pumping at different rates. The solution is used to investigate the behavior of multiple well pairs, looking at how well placement and pumping rates impact capture zone width and fraction recirculation (and, therefore, overall treatment efficiency). Results of the two-well solution are compared with data obtained at a recent field-scale demonstration of in situ aerobic cometabolic bioremediation, where a pair of dual-screened injection/extraction wells was evaluated. A numerical model is then used to evaluate the impact of hydraulic conductivity anisotropy on the overall treatment efficiency of the dual-screened injection/extraction well pair. The method presented here provides a fast and accurate technique for determining the efficacy of injection/extraction systems, and represents a tool that can be useful when designing such in situ treatment systems.},

   abstract = {The fact that dependent variables of groundwater models are generally nonlinear functions of model parameters is shown to be a potentially significant factor in calculating accurate confidence intervals for both model parameters and functions of the parameters, such as the values of dependent variables calculated by the model. The Lagrangian method of Vecchia and Cooley [Vecchia, A.V. & Cooley, R.L., Water Resources Research, 1987, 23(7), 1237-1250] was used to calculate nonlinear Scheffe-type confidence intervals for the parameters and the simulated heads of a steady-state groundwater flow model covering 450 km(2) of a leaky aquifer. The nonlinear confidence intervals are compared to corresponding linear intervals. As suggested by the significant nonlinearity of the regression model, linear confidence intervals are often not accurate. The commonly made assumption that widths of linear confidence intervals always underestimate the actual (nonlinear) widths was not correct. Results show that nonlinear effects can cause the nonlinear intervals to be asymmetric and either larger or smaller than the linear approximations. Prior information on transmissivities helps reduce the size of the confidence intervals, with the most notable effects occurring for the parameters on which there is prior information and for head values in parameter zones for which there is prior information on the parameters.

To compute the intervals, we assumed that each predicted value can be written as the sum of a computed dependent variable and a random error. Testing was accomplished by using a cross-validation method and by using new field measurements of hydraulic heads and transmissivities that were not used to develop or calibrate the models. The tested null hypotheses are that the coverage probability of the prediction intervals is not significantly smaller than the assumed probability (95%) and that each tail probability is not significantly different from the assumed probability (2.5%). In all cases tested, these hypotheses were accepted at the 5% level of significance. We therefore conclude that for the groundwater models of two real aquifers the individual prediction intervals appear to be accurate.},

This bias originates from model nonlinearity. In spite of this bias, predictions of hydraulic head are nearly unbiased if the model intrinsic nonlinearity is small.

   abstract = {There is growing interest in the use of back-propagation neural networks to model non-linear multivariate problems in geotehnical engineering. To overcome the shortcomings of the conventional back-propagation neural network, such as overfitting, where the neural network learns the spurious details and noise in the training examples, a hybrid back-propagation algorithm has been developed. The method utilizes the genetic algorithms search technique and the Bayesian neural network methodology. The genetic algorithms enhance the stochastic search to locate the global minima for the neural network model. The Bayesian inference procedures essentially provide better generalization and a statistical approach to deal with data uncertainty in comparison with the conventional back-propagation. The uncertainty of data can be indicated using error bars. Two examples are presented to demonstrate the convergence and generalization capabilities of this hybrid algorithm.

We analyze the uncertainty of capturing the plumes by funnel-and-gate systems in heterogeneous aquifers. Restricting the analysis to two-dimensional, steady state flow, we characterize plume capture by the values of the stream function at the boundaries of the plume and the funnels. On the basis of the covariance of the log conductivity distribution we compute the covariance matrix of the relevant stream function values by a matrix-based first-order second-moment method, making use of efficient matrix-multiplication techniques. From the covariance matrix of stream function values, we can approximate the probability that the plume is bypassing the funnels. We condition the log conductivity field to measurements of the log conductivity and the hydraulic head. Prior to performing additional measurements, we estimate their worth by the expected reduction in the variance of stream function differences. In an application to a hypothetical aquifer, we demonstrate that our method of uncertainty propagation and our sampling strategy enable us to discriminate between cases of success and failure of funnel-and-gate systems with a small number of additional samples.},

   abstract = {A numerical model is used for simulating the stimulation of biomass growth by injection of alternating pulses of a primary substrate and oxygen. We consider that the substrate sorbs, whereas oxygen does not undergo mass transfer, and mixing of the reacting compounds is dominated by the chromatographic effect. Different mathematical formulations for biomass growth and decay are compared. In models considering biomass decay, a minimal time of joint exposure to both reactants can be determined. This leads to a multimodal distribution of the biomass after multiple injection cycles. In multidimensional heterogeneous domains, the location of the biomass peaks is determined by the advective arrival time. The biomass is much more homogeneously distributed when biomass decay is neglected, because under this condition there is no constraint by a minimal joint exposure time. For the case of oxygen-dependent biomass decay, an injection scheme using shorter pulses of higher oxygen concentrations is shown to be superior to a scheme with equally long pulses of oxygen and the substrate.

   abstract = {Breakthrough curves of a conservative tracer in a heterogeneous two-dimensional aquifer are analyzed by means of their temporal moments. The average velocity and the longitudinal macrodispersion coefficient of the equivalent one-dimensional aquifer obtained through cross-sectional averaging of concentration can be defined from the first and second central moments of a breakthrough curve integrated over the outflow boundary of the domain. On the basis of an integrated breakthrough curve, one cannot distinguish between actual solute dilution, which involves concentration reduction, and variability of arrival times among parts of the plume at different cross-sectional positions. Analyzing the temporal moments of breakthrough curves at a "point" within the domain gives additional information about the dilution of the tracer. From these local first and second central moments an apparent seepage velocity v(a) and an apparent dispersivity of mixing alpha(a) can be derived. For short travel distances, alpha(a) equals the local-scale longitudinal dispersivity. It increases with the travel distance but much more slowly than the macrodispersivity. At the large-distance limit, alpha(a) may eventually reach the level of macrodispersivity. Lenses of high conductivity where groundwater flow converges are identified as regions of preferential enhanced mixing. The spatial distribution of these regions causes a high degree of variability of alpha(a) within a domain, indicating a high degree of uncertainty in the quantification of dilution at early stages. In an accompanying paper [Cirpka and Kitanidis, this issue] the results of conservative tracer transport are utilized for the study of mixing-controlled reactive transport.},

Temporal moments of the tracer breakthrough curve integrated over the outflow boundary of the domain yield the average velocity and the path-averaged macrodispersion coefficient. On the basis of this information alone, no distinction is possible between spreading and mixing of the tracer. Analyzing the temporal moments of breakthrough curves locally obtained at single points in the domain gives additional information about the dilution of the tracer. In an accompanying paper [Cirpka ann Kitanidis, this issue] we derive an apparent Peclet number of mixing Pe(a) from local temporal moments. Assuming that Pe(a) is constant over the cross section of the outflow boundary, a corrected probability density function of arrival times is determined. By interpreting the spatially integrated breakthrough curve as the result of advective-dispersive transport in independent stream tubes with identical Peclet number but differing seepage velocity, it is possible to transfer results of conservative transport to the transport of interacting compounds for cases in which mixing of the compounds is influenced significantly by local-scale dispersion. This is an improvement to the stochastic-convective model of Simmons et al. [1995] for the transfer of integrated tracer data to reactive transport. The approach is applied to the hypothetical case of a bimolecular reaction in a heterogeneous two-dimensional aquifer.},

Recirculation is characterized by the discharge densities over travel time. We apply the model to the stimulation of cometabolic dechlorination of trichloroethene (TCE) by alternate injection of oxygen and toluene into the circulation wells. Mixing within the wells can be minimized by interposing sufficiently long breaks between the oxygen and toluene pulses. In our simulation, the proposed injection scheme stimulates biomass growth without risking biofouling of the aquifer.},

   abstract = {The presence of an immobile gaseous phase in an otherwise-saturated porous medium affects the transport of volatile compounds. The linear theory of partitioning tracers suggests that a volatile tracer introduced into such a system should be retarded with a constant retardation factor. Using high concentrations, however, the saturation of the gaseous phase will change as an effect of the tracer test itself. Competitive gas transfer among all volatile compounds and the change of saturation may lead to tracer concentrations that are temporarily higher than those injected. We analyze the system in the framework of the coherence theory by Helfferich [Soc. pet. Eng. J. 21 (1) (1981) 51]. The governing equations are formulated as functions of total concentration, i.e., the mass of solutes in all phases per pore volume. Neglecting dispersion and mass-transfer kinetics, we derive the characteristic form of the resulting system of hyperbolic equations. In a system with N volatile compounds, a variation of the concentrations splits up into N waves, each traveling with its own characteristic velocity. If the presence of a gaseous phase is sustained, one wave will be a standing one. We perform numerical model calculations for tracers with various Henry's law coefficients and show that the results agree with the: semi-analytical solution obtained by coherence theory.

   abstract = {[1] Geostatistical interpolation of log conductivity measurements leads to velocity fields lacking small-scale variability whereas large-scale features are covered well. The unresolved, small-scale velocity fluctuations cause underestimation of macrodispersion, dilution, and mixing in subsequent transport calculations. The same holds when the best linear unbiased estimate of geostatistical inverse methods is used in flow and transport simulations. Considering a regular grid of measurement points, we approximate the lack of dispersion, to which we refer as correction dispersion, by applying first-order theory to the conditional covariance of the kriged log conductivity field. The nonstationarity of the conditional covariance is removed by averaging it over space. We distinguish between macrodispersion, describing the rate of change in the second spatial moments of a large plume, and effective dispersion of a plume introduced as a point source, parameterizing dilution and mixing. Depending on the objective, we either add a correction macrodispersion tensor or a correction effective dispersion tensor to the true local dispersion tensor in transport calculations on the smoothed log conductivity field. The numerical application to a two-dimensional periodic domain shows excellent agreement in the one- and two-particle moments between simulations on the highly resolved field and those on the interpolated one using corrected values for the local dispersion coefficients.},

   abstract = {Evaluating uncertainty in solute transport under nonstationary flow conditions is a computationally demanding task. This is particularly true for cases with a two-point covariance function of log conductivity depending on the actual positions of the points rather than their distance vector. These may occur when the geological formation exhibits a trend. Nonstationarity can also be the result of uncertainty in the trend parameters of the mean log conductivity value, or it may originate from conditioning of the log conductivity field to measurements of, for example, head or conductivity. We present an efficient numerical method for evaluating the variance of travel time in such formations. We cover cases in which the nonstationary covariance functions are constructed from stationary counterparts, either by scaling functions or by summation with nonstationary functions resulting from marginalization or conditioning. We apply a matrix-based first-order second-moment (FOSM) method for uncertainty propagation, using the continuous adjoint-state method for coupled systems to evaluate the sensitivity matrix. The resulting matrix-matrix multiplications are accelerated by fast Fourier transformation (FFT) techniques after periodic embedding of the covariance matrices referring to the stationary counterparts. The combination of these methods makes it possible to compute the travel time uncertainty in domains discretized by several hundred thousand log conductivity values on standard personal computers within a reasonable time-frame. For demonstration, we apply the method to a binary medium and a medium exhibiting a continuous trend in the covariance function. In the latter application we also demonstrate the effects of marginalization and conditioning.},

   abstract = {Distributed hydrological modelling using space-time estimates of rainfall from weather radar provides a natural approach to area-wide flood forecasting and warning at any location, whether gauged or ungauged. However, radar estimates of rainfall may lack consistent, quantitative accuracy. Also, the formulation of hydrological models in distributed form may be problematic due to process complexity and scaling issues. Here, the aim is to first explore ways of improving radar rainfall accuracy through combination with raingauge network data via integrated multiquadric methods. When the resulting gridded rainfall estimates are employed as input to hydrological models, the simulated river flows show marked improvements when compared to using radar data alone. Secondly, simple forms of physical-conceptual distributed hydrological model are considered, capable of exploiting spatial datasets on topography and, where necessary, land-cover, soil and geology properties. The simplest Grid-to-Grid model uses only digital terrain data to delineate flow pathways and to control runoff production, the latter by invoking a probability-distributed relation linking terrain slope to soil absorption capacity. Model performance is assessed over nested river basins in northwest England, employing a lumped model as a reference. When the distributed model is used with the gridded radar-based rainfall estimators, it shows particular benefits for forecasting at ungauged locations.},

The authors recommend that this model be as simple, or smooth, as possible. To obtain smooth models, the nonlinear forward problem is linearized about a starting model in the usual way, but it is then solved explicitly for the desired model rather than for a model correction. By parameterizing the model in terms of its first or second derivative with depth, the minimum norm solution yields the smoothest possible model. Rather than fitting the experimental data as well as possible, the smoothest model which fits the data to within an expected tolerance is sought. A practical scheme is developed which optimizes the step size at each iteration and retains the computational efficiency of layered models, resulting in a stable and rapidly convergent algorithm. The inversion of both magnetotelluric and Schlumberger sounding field data is used as an application. (26 refs.)},

The analysis shows that the pilot point and conditional simulation method of model calibration and uncertainty analysis can produce accurate uncertainty measures if it can be assumed that errors of unknown origin in the differences between observed and model-computed water pressures are small. When this assumption is not met, the method could yield significant errors from overparameterization and the neglect of potential sources of model inaccuracy. The conditional simulation part of the method is also shown to be a variant of the percentile bootstrap method, so that when applied to a nonlinear model, the method is subject to bootstrap errors. These sources of error must be considered when using the method.},

   abstract = {Groundwater models need to account for detailed but generally unknown spatial variability (heterogeneity) of the hydrogeologic model inputs. To address this problem we replace the large, m-dimensional stochastic vector beta that reflects both small and large scales of heterogeneity in the inputs by a lumped or smoothed m-dimensional approximation gamma theta(*), where gamma is an interpolation matrix and theta(*) is a stochastic vector of parameters. Vector theta(*) has small enough dimension to allow its estimation with the available data. The consequence of the replacement is that model function f(gamma theta(8)) written in terms of the approximate inputs is in error with respect to the same model function written in terms of beta, f(beta), which is assumed to be nearly exact. The difference f(beta) - f(gamma theta(*)), termed model error, is spatially correlated, generates prediction biases, and causes standard confidence and prediction intervals to be too small. Model error is accounted for in the weighted nonlinear regression methodology developed to estimate theta(*) and assess model uncertainties by incorporating the second-moment matrix of the model errors into the weight matrix. Techniques developed by statisticians to analyze classical nonlinear regression methods are extended to analyze the revised method. The analysts develops analytical expressions for bias terms reflecting the interaction of model nonlinearity and model error, for correction factors needed to adjust the sizes of confidence and prediction intervals for this interaction, and for correction factors needed to adjust the sizes of confidence and prediction intervals for possible use of a diagonal weight matrix in place of the correct one. If terms expressing the degree of intrinsic nonlinearity for f(beta) and f(gamma theta(*)) are small, then most of the biases are small and the correction factors are reduced in magnitude. Biases, correction factors, and confidence and prediction intervals were obtained for a test problem for which model error is large to test robustness of the methodology. Numerical results conform with the theoretical analysis. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In these cases, solutions to the diffusion - convection equation are derived from the solution of a different problem, namely the continuous injection of a tracer. Within this procedure, spike injection results from the time derivative of this solution, and finite-step injection from the superposition of two solutions shifted in time. In this paper we show that although this methodology is mathematically correct, attention should be paid to the properties of the solutions. Their boundary conditions may not represent physically acceptable situations, since these conditions are inherited from a different problem. The application of the methodology to a simple one-dimensional case of a tracer pulse diffusing in a homogeneous, semi-infinite reservoir shows serious problems regarding boundary conditions and mass conservation. These problems has not probably been found before since tracer breakthrough curves are not very sensitive to them. However, the problems clearly show up when the tracer distribution in space is analyzed. We conclude that the traditional methodology should not be employed. Equations should be solved imposing the specific boundary and initial conditions corresponding to the original system under consideration.},

Like particle tracking, the pressure field is computed on an underlying grid using conventional techniques. The flow velocity at cell edges is then computed using Darcy's law, and this information is used to trace streamlines throughout the domain. In particle tracking, mass is transported by moving particles along streamlines. In the method we describe, a one-dimensional conservation equation is solved numerically along each streamline. If the flow field changes, the solute concentration is mapped onto the underlying grid and the streamlines are recomputed. The concentration is then mapped back onto the new streamlines, and the simulation proceeds as before. The method is suited for modeling advectively dominated multispecies transport in heterogeneous aquifers. We illustrate the streamline approach with synthetic example problems in fully saturated, confined aquifers: conservative, sorbing, and decaying tracer; a four-component radioactive decay chain; and saltwater intrusion where the flow field changes with time. Where possible, we compare the results with analytical solutions and results from particle tracking codes.},

Past applications involving the EBF have been made mostly in confined aquifers (Kabala 1994; Boman et al. 1997; Podgorney and Ritzi 1997; Ruud and Kabala 1997a, 1997b; Flach et al. 2000), and it has been common to set up a flow field around a test well using a small pump that is located near the top of the well screen (Molz and Young 1993). In thin, unconfined aquifers that exhibit ground water tables near the ground surface and that undergo drawdown during pumping, such a configuration can be problematical because pumping and associated drawdown may effectively isolate the upper portion of the aquifer from the flowmeter. In these instances, a steady-state flow field in the vicinity of the test well may be created using injection rather than pumping, allowing for testing in the otherwise isolated upper portion of the aquifer located near the initial water table position. Using procedures developed by Molz and Young (1993), which were modified for an injection mode application, testing was conducted to determine whether or not the injection mode would provide useful information in a shallow, unconfined aquifer that required the collection of data near the initial water table position. Results indicated that the injection mode for the EBF was well suited for this objective.},

In this study, experiment quality is defined to measure the constraints on a particular model offered by the anticipated experimental data (that is, it measures anticipated model information post-experiment). Physical and financial constraints define the space of possible experimental designs. The definitions used here require that the relationship between model parameters and data can be linearized without significant loss of information. Two new measures of model information are introduced and compared to three previously known measures. One of the new measures can be calculated extremely efficiently allowing experiments constraining large model spaces to be designed. This efficiency trades off with a lack of sensitivity to poorly constrained parts of the model. Each measure is used independently to design a cross-borehole tomographic survey including surface sources and receivers (henceforth called nodes) which maximally constrains the interborehole velocity structure. The boreholes are vertical and the background velocity is assumed to be approximately constant. Features common to most or all optimal designs form robust design criteria--"rules of thumb"--which can be applied to design future experiments. These are: (1) surface nodes significantly improve designs; (2) node density increases steadily down the length of each well; (3) surface node density is increased slightly around the central point between the wells; (4) average node density on the ground surface is lower than that down each well. Three of these criteria are shown to be intuitively reasonable (the fourth is not), but the current method is quantitative and hence may be applied in situations where intuition breaks down (for example, non-vertical wells with multilateral splays; combining different data types: inversion for anisotropic model parameters). In such cases the optimal design is usually not obvious, but can be found using the quantitative methods introduced and discussed herein.},

   volume = {265},
   pages = {189-215},
   abstract = {A Lagrangian framework is used for analysing reactive solute transport by a steady random velocity field, which is associated with flow through a heterogeneous porous formation. The reaction considered is kinetically controlled sorption-desorption. Transport is quantified by the expected values of spatial and temporal moments that are derived as functions of the non-reactive moments and a distribution function which characterizes sorption kinetics. Thus the results of this study generalize the previously obtained results for transport of non-reactive solutes in heterogeneous formations (Dagan 1984; Dagan et al. 1992). The results are illustrated for first-order linear sorption reactions. The general effect of sorption is to retard the solute movement. For short time, the transport process coincides with a non-reactive case, whereas for large time sorption is in equilibrium and solute is simply retarded by a factor R=1+K{sub d} where K{sub d} is the partitioning coefficient. Within these limits, the interaction between the heterogeneity and kinetics yields characteristic nonlinearities in the first three spatial moments. Asymmetry in the spatial solute distribution is a typical kinetic effect. Critical parameters that control sorptive transport asymptotically are the ratio epsilon {sub r} between a typical reaction length and the longitudinal effective (non-reactive) dispersivity, and K{sub d}. The asymptotic effective dispersivity for equilibrium conditions is derived as a function of parameters epsilon {sub r} and K{sub d}. A qualitative agreement with field data is illustrated for the zero- and first-order spatial moments. (45 refs.)},

Two types of reactions are considered: Langmuir sorption and mineral dissolution. Two-phase immiscible displacement of oil by water (Buckley-Leverett flow) is also analysed. Both reactions and heterogeneity enhance the field-scale dispersive effects. The relative influence of the heterogeneity and reactions on the field-scale dispersion depends on the scale of the transport problem relative to the heterogeneity integral scale on the one hand, and the reaction parameters on the other. The dispersive effect due to sorption nonlinearity may dominate over the effects of heterogeneity. Similarly, for heavier oil, i.e. for small water to oil viscosity ratio, the effect of nonlinearity in the two-phase immiscible dynamics will generally dominate over the heterogeneity for large transport times. If the characteristic transport time, defined as the ratio between the reservoir scale and the flow velocity, is comparable to the heterogeneity characteristic time I/U, heterogeneous fingering and nonlinear two-phase dynamics yield comparable rates of dispersion.

   abstract = {Steady flow of incompressible fluids takes place in geological formations of spatially variable permeability. The permeability is regarded as a stationary random space function (RSF) of given statistical moments. The fluid carries reactive solutes and we consider, for illustration purposes, two types of reactions: nonlinear equilibrium sorption of a single species and mineral dissolution (linear kinetics). In addition, we analyse the nonlinear problem of horizontal flow of two immiscible fluids (the Buckley-Leverett flow). We consider injection at constant concentration in a semi-infinite domain at constant initial concentration and we neglect the effect of pore scale dispersion. The field-scale transport problem consists of characterizing an erratic plume, or displacement front, emanating from a given source area along distinct random flow paths. Reactive transport along three-dimensional flow paths is transformed to a one-dimensional Lagrangian-Eulerian domain ( tau ,t), where tau is the fluid residence time and t is the real time. Due to nonlinearity, discontinuities (shock waves) along a flow path may develop. Close form solutions are obtained for the expected values of the spatial and temporal moments of a nonlinearly reacting solute plume, or of two immiscible fluids. These results generalize the previous results for linearly reacting solute (Cvetkovic and Dagan 1994). The general results are illustrated and discussed in part II. (30 refs.)},

   abstract = {Geostatistical techniques are increasingly being used for modeling reservoir heterogeneity and assessment of uncertainty in performance predictions. Although a large number of stochastic reservoir models or realizations may be generated, in practice only a small fraction can be considered for comprehensive flow simulation. This can be done through a ranking process. Several papers have been published in the literature on ranking of realizations. However, a consistent set of criteria for model ranking still remains unclear.In this paper we propose a connectivity criterion based on the streamline time-of-flight and use this criterion to rank geostatististical realizations for detailed flow simulation purposes and risk assessment. Because the time-of-flights reflect the fluid front propagation at various times, the connectivity in the time-of-flight provides us with a direct measure of volumetric sweep efficiency. Thus, our proposed approach provides, for the first time, a method for computing volumetric sweep efficiency for arbitrary heterogeneity and well configuration. We show that the proposed connectivity criterion exhibits strong correlation with waterflood recovery and thus, can be used for ranking stochastic reservoir models. Unlike permeability connectivity which is a static measure independent of the flow field, the time of flight connectivity rigorously accounts for the interaction between the flow field and the underlying heterogeneity.Our proposed approach has been applied to synthetic as well as field examples. Synthetic examples are used to validate the sweep efficiency calculations using the streamline time-of-flight connectivity criterion by comparison with analytic solutions and published correlations. These examples also demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the ranking criterion over existing methods. The field example is from the North Robertson Unit, a low permeability carbonate reservoir in west Texas. Our example includes multiple patterns consisting of 27 producers and 15 injectors and illustrates the feasibility of the approach for large-scale field applications.},

Issues of connectivity and heterogeneity which play a key role in fractured reservoirs are generally better addressed by discrete feature network (DFN) approach rather than simplified equivalent porous medium (EPM) approaches. The popular dual porosity (DP) approach for analysis of fractured reservoirs does not address connectivity issues, although it does add a second interacting continuum to reflect storage effects. This paper presents newly developed techniques to directly and quantitatively derive EPM and DP parameters using DFN models.},

The fluid flux through a fracture system is often several orders of magnitude greater than the flux through the matrix, even though the total porosity of the matrix may be much greater than that of the fractures. The volume of interconnected void space actually contributing to flow (the effective porosity) in the fracture network is usually substantially higher than that of the matrix. For these reasons it is important to have the ability to predict flow in fractured systems, to know the scale at which fractures must be studied in the field, and to verify the accuracy of current transport prediction methods. A field study of flow through the highly fractured, Mississippian aged, Floyd Shale of Floyd County, Georgia, was conducted by running a series of NaCl tracer tests. The fracture system was artificially saturated and the tracer injected 40-feet updip from the outcrop. Samples from each discharge point on the outcrop were used to construct tracer discharge hydrographs, and from these the average linear velocity through the fractured shale was determined. From the outcrop 826 fracture measurements of strike, dip, aperture, and density distribution were used to determine major fracture orientations and to apply to D. T. Snows (1968) equivalent continuum model of a cubic fracture system. An average linear velocity for the fracture system was calculated from Snows model using the above fracture data. Also, the aquifer properties determined from the tracer data were applied to the Prickett and Lonnquist Aquifer Simulation Model (1971), an equivalent porous media model, to simulate the fractured flow system observed in the field. An average linear velocity from the Prickett and Lonnquist (1971) model was also determined. The average linear velocities from the above equivalent continuum models were then compared to the velocity measured in the field to: a) determine how closely such models can reproduce the field results, and b) determine what data is most useful in modeling a fractured flow system.},

The study achieves the goals through an improved understanding and description of the sampling phenomena based on the concepts of fractal geometry and incorporating the knowledge of the accuracy of the sampling (fractal model) in the stochastic optimization framework thereby, automating and improving the combinatorial optimization algorithm. The efficiency of the algorithm is presented in the context of a large scale real world problem, related to the nuclear waste at Hanford, involving discrete and continuous decision variables, and uncertainties. These new developments reduced the computational intensity for solving this problem from an estimated 20 days of CPU time on a dedicated Alpha workstation to 18 hours of CPU time on the same machine.

   abstract = {This presentation discusses the evolution of discrete fracture methods and their practical applications. The discrete fracture network modeling approach is a combination of technologies from the rock mechanics and hydrogeologic disciplines. It combines methods from rock mechanic and structural geology, which describe fracture geometries, with flow simulation methods from hydrogeology. The approach attempts to reproduce realistically the conducting portion of fracture networks. Simulating all of the fractures in a rock volume is seldom practical. A key step in developing an analysis is reducing the problem to its hydraulically significant components. We discuss three methods with examples for making this reduction. "Truncation" defines the conductive fracture intensity based on a cutoff transmissivity value. Truncations takes advantage of packer testing and flow logging methods that help define the conductive fracture intensity. "Localization" involves generating detailed networks near boundaries, such as boreholes, tunnels, or along critical pathways and using generalized or sparse networks elsewhere. Localization may also concentrate on critical conductors that are defined deterministically. If the medium can be described as a stochastic continuum at larger scales we can use a "numerical permeameter" approach. Numerical permeameters use multiple realizations of fracture networks at the scale of continuum discretization to define continuum-equivalent properties.},

The computation of these flow rates is not a trivial task when a finite-element method is chosen to solve the groundwater equation. Generally, it is believed that finite-element methods do not conserve mass locally. In this paper, a postprocessing technique is developed to compute mass-conserving flow rates at element faces. It postprocesses the groundwater head field obtained by the Galerkin finite-element method, and the calculated flow rates conserve mass locally and globally. The only requirement for the postprocessor to be applicable is the irrotationality of the flow field, i.e., the curl of the Darcy flux should be zero. The accuracy and the mass conservation properties of the new postprocessor are demonstrated using several test problems that include one-, two-, and three-dimensional flow systems in both homogeneous and heterogeneous aquifer conditions.},

   abstract = {The use of a fitted parameter watershed model to address water quantity and quality management issues requires that it be calibrated under a wide range of hydrologic conditions. However, rarely does model calibration result in a unique parameter set. Parameter nonuniqueness can lead to predictive nonuniqueness. The extent of model predictive uncertainty should be investigated if management decisions are to be based on model projections. Using models built for four neighboring watersheds in the Neuse River Basin of North Carolina, the application of the automated parameter optimization software PEST in conjunction with the Hydrologic Simulation Program Fortran (HSPF) is demonstrated. Parameter nonuniqueness is illustrated, and a method is presented for calculating many different sets of parameters, all of which acceptably calibrate a watershed model. A regularization methodology is discussed in which models for similar watersheds can be calibrated simultaneously. Using this method, parameter differences between watershed models can be minimized while maintaining fit between model outputs and field observations. In recognition of the fact that parameter nonuniqueness and predictive uncertainty are inherent to the modeling process, PEST's nonlinear predictive analysis functionality is then used to explore the extent of model predictive uncertainty.

   abstract = {&#8220;Structural noise&#8221; is a term often used to describe model-to-measurement misfit that cannot be ascribed to measurement noise and therefore must be ascribed to the imperfect nature of a numerical model as a simulator of reality. As such, it is often the dominant contributor to model-to-measurement misfit. As the name &#8220;structural noise&#8221; implies, this type of misfit is often treated as an additive term to measurement noise when assessing model parameter and predictive uncertainty. This paper inquires into the nature of defect-induced model-to-measurement misfit and provides a conceptual basis for accommodating it. It is shown that inasmuch as defect-induced model-to-measurement misfit can be characterized as &#8220;noise,&#8221; this noise is likely to show a high degree of spatial and temporal correlation; furthermore, its covariance matrix may approach singularity. However, the deleterious impact of structural noise on the model calibration process may be mitigated in a variety of ways. These include adoption of a highly parameterized approach to model construction and calibration (including the strategic use of compensatory parameters where appropriate), processing of observations and their model-generated counterparts in ways that are able to filter out structural noise prior to fitting one to the other, and/or through implementation of a weighting strategy that gives prominence to observations that most resemble predictions required of a model.},

This heuristic, probabilistic optimization method seeks minima in analogy with the annealing of solids and is effective on large-scale problems.  No continuity requirements are imposed on objective (cost) functions.  Constraints may be added to the cost function via penalties, imposed by designation of the solution domain, or imbedded in submodels (e.g., mass balance in aquifer flow simulators) used to evaluate costs.  The location of global optima may be theoretically guaranteed, but computational limitations lead to searches for nearly optimal solutions in practice.  Like other optimization methods, most of the computational effort is expended in flow and transport simulators.  Practical algorithmic guidance that leads to enormous computational savings and sometimes makes simulated annealing competitive with gradient-type optimization methods is provided.  The method is illustrated by example applications to idealized problems of groundwater flow and selection of remediation strategy, including optimization with multiple groundwater control technologies.  They demonstrate the flexibility of the method and indicate its potential for solving groundwater management problems.  The application of simulated annealing to water resources problems is new and its development is immature, so further performance improvements can be expected.},

   abstract = {Soil and fractured saprolite formed from weathered Middle Cambrian sedimentary rocks were analyzed from two shallow (< 2.5 m deep) pits located at the Oak Ridge Reservation in eastern Tennessee. The effects of both parent heterogeneity and pedogenic processes on fracture and matrix porosity were examined using thin-section petrography and geochemistry. The A and Bw horizons of the soil profiles comprise thin (20-60 cm), weakly developed, loamy inceptisols characterized by high (40-50%) matrix porosity. Subjacent saprolite with pore-occluding pedogenic clay (Crt horizon) occurs beneath a saprolite without pedogenic clay (Cr horizon) and varies lithologically depending on parent material (limestone, siltstone and shale, or sandstone). The soil and saprolite commonly contain root pores; the saprolite additionally contains bedding-parallel and bedding-perpendicular (orthogonal) fracture sets. The fractures and root holes were initially expected to control "bulk" or mesoscale hydraulic conductivity of the materials. This study indicates, however, that extensive pedogenic clay and Fe/Mn-oxide accumulations in the pores and fractures in the saprolite, at depths of 100-250 cm, cause porosity reduction that is so extensive it serves to create a low-hydraulic-conductivity barrier within the upper vadose zone. This barrier is known from prior work to cause formation of perched water-table conditions and rapid downslope flow during rainfall events, but this is the first study to investigate the origin of the low-conductivity barrier.  Geochemical mass balance, using Ti as an immobile index, also demonstrates that three distinct weathering environments defined by element translocation patterns occur in each pit, which correspond to the soil zone (A and Bw horizons), shallow saprolite (Cr horizon), and deep saprolite (Crt horizon). The geochemical zonation is also consistent with the pedogenic and hydraulic interpretation of the system. The potential environmental significance of the zone of pore occlusion is also discussed from the perspective of runoff, recharge, and contaminant migration.},

   abstract = {The extended Kalman filter (EKF) has long been recognized as a powerful, yet computationally intensive, methodology for stochastic parameter estimation: Three improvements to traditional algorithms are presented and applied to heterogeneous transmissivity estimation. First, the costly EKF covariance updates are replaced by more efficient approximations. Second, the zonation structure of the distributed parameter field being estimated is dynamically determined and refined using a partitional clustering algorithm. Third, a new method of merging first and second moments of random fields that have heterogeneous statistics is introduced. We apply this method, called random field union, as an alternative to conventional random field averaging for the systematic shrinking of covariance matrices as the dimensionality of the parameter space is reduced. The effects of these three improvements are examined. In applications to steady state groundwater flow test problems, we show that the first and second improvements reduce the computational time requirements dramatically, while the second and third can improve the accuracy and stability of the results. The resulting integrated method is successfully applied to a larger, more realistic calibration test case under steady and cyclostationary flow conditions (similar to regular seasonal fluctuations). When flow is steady, the method can-be viewed as iterative; when flow is transient, the method is fully recursive.},

   abstract = {We present an approximate method for generating the Jacobian matrix of sensitivities required by linearized, iterative procedures for inverting electromagnetic measurements. The approximation is based on the adjoint-equation method in which the sensitivities are obtained by integrating, over each cell, the scalar product of an adjoint electric field (the adjoint Green's function) with the electric field produced by the forward modelling at the end of the preceding iteration. Instead of computing the adjoint field in the multidimensional conductivity model, we compute an approximate adjoint field, either in a homogeneous or layered half-space. Such an approximate adjoint field is significantly faster to compute than the true adjoint field. This leads to a considerable reduction in computation time over the exact sensitivities. The speed-up can be one or two orders of magnitude, with the relative difference increasing with the size of the problem. Sensitivities calculated using the approximate adjoint field appear to be good approximations to the exact sensitivities. This is verified by comparing true and approximate sensitivities for 2- and 3-D conductivity models, and for sources that are both finite and infinite in extent. The approximation is sufficiently accurate to allow an iterative inversion algorithm to converge to the desired result, and we illustrate this by inverting magnetotelluric data to recover a 2-D conductivity structure. Our approximate sensitivities should enable larger inverse problems to be solved than is currently feasible using exact sensitivities and present-day computing power.},

   volume = {44},
   abstract = {Water table elevations are usually sampled in space using piezometric measurements that are unfortunately expensive to obtain and are thus scarce over space. Most of the time, piezometric data are sparsely distributed over large areas, thus providing limited direct information about the level of the corresponding water table. As a consequence, there is a real need for approaches that are able at the same time to (1) provide spatial predictions at unsampled locations and (2) enable the user to account for all potentially available secondary information sources that are in some way related to water table elevations. In this paper, a recently developed Bayesian data fusion (BDF) framework is applied to the problem of water table spatial mapping. After a brief presentation of the underlying theory, specific assumptions are made and discussed to account for a digital elevation model and for the geometry of a corresponding river network. On the basis of a data set for the Dijle basin in the north part of Belgium, the suggested model is then implemented and results are compared to those of standard techniques such as ordinary kriging and cokriging. Respective accuracies and precisions of these estimators are finally evaluated using a ‚Äúleave-one-out‚Äù cross-validation procedure. Although the BDF methodology was illustrated here for the integration of only two secondary information sources (namely, a digital elevation model and the geometry of a river network), the method can be applied for incorporating an arbitrary number of secondary information sources, thus opening new avenues for the important topic of data integration in a spatial mapping context.},

In this case study the stepwise approach is used to evaluate the fate of recharge in the Menomonee Valley adjacent to Lake Michigan. Two major receptors exist for recharge that flows through contaminated valley fill: the surface water estuary and a tunnel system constructed similar to75 to 110 in below land surface to store storm runoff. The primary objective of the modeling is to delineate the contributing areas of recharge to each receptor. Of interest is the ability of the one-layer regional model to furnish flux boundary conditions to the local three-dimensional model despite the presence of vertical flow conditions at the boundaries of the local model. Sensitivity analysis suggests that the local model was insensitive to the vertical distribution of the flux. Each step of the modeling approach demonstrates that both receptors play an important role in capturing valley recharge. The pattern of capture of the one-layer model differed in shape from that delineated by the multi-layer local model in the presence of a flow system with pronounced vertical anisotropy and with sinks drawing water from different elevations.},

   abstract = {In this work, we address the problem of characterizing the heterogeneity and uncertainty of hydraulic properties for complex geological settings. Hereby, we distinguish between two scales of heterogeneity, namely the hydrofacies structure and the intrafacies variability of the hydraulic properties. We employ multiple-point geostatistics to characterize the hydrofacies architecture. The multiple-point statistics are borrowed from a training image that is designed to reflect the prior geological conceptualization. The intrafacies variability of the hydraulic properties is represented using conventional two-point correlation methods, more precisely, spatial covariance models under a multi-Gaussian spatial law. We address the different levels and sources of uncertainty in characterizing the subsurface heterogeneity, and explore their effect on groundwater flow and transport predictions. Typically, uncertainty is assessed by way of many images, termed realizations, of a fixed statistical model. However, in many cases, sampling from a fixed stochastic model does not adequately represent the space of uncertainty. It neglects the uncertainty related to the selection of the stochastic model and the estimation of its input parameters. We acknowledge the uncertainty inherent in the definition of the prior conceptual model of aquifer architecture and in the estimation of global statistics, anisotropy, and correlation scales. Spatial bootstrap is used to assess the uncertainty of the unknown statistical parameters. As an illustrative example, we employ a synthetic field that represents a fluvial setting consisting of an interconnected network of channel sands embedded within finer-grained floodplain material. For this highly non-stationary setting we quantify the groundwater flow and transport model prediction uncertainty for various levels of hydrogeological uncertainty. Results indicate the importance of accurately describing the facies geometry, especially for transport predictions. CP 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. (38 Refs.)},

   abstract = {The paper presents a methodology to estimate the uncertainty in the prediction of capture zones using transmissivity measurements and hydraulic head observations. We use a stochastic approach to parameterise the transmissivity field. By treating the parameters of the stochastic model as random variables we account for the fact that they are unknown and that a simple deterministic process cannot model their genesis. The method requires the definition of a prior probability density function for the mean value and for the covariance parameters of the log transmissivity field. In a first phase, log transmissivity measurements are incorporated into Bayes' theorem updating the prior densities to yield the posterior densities for the model parameters. Conditional realisations of the log transmissivity field are generated using parameter sets obtained by Monte Carlo sampling from the posterior parameter distributions. The second phase consists of updating the posterior probabilities of the conditional log transmissivity fields using the hydraulic head observations through a second application of Bayes' theorem. Then, for each realisation of the log transmissivity field, the capture zone is determined using particle tracking, which is weighted by the posterior probabilities of the respective log transmissivity field. The set of weighted capture zones results in a capture zone probability distribution. We show an application to a hypothetical flow system consisting of a single abstraction well in a confined aquifer under a regional background gradient and compare the worth of log transmissivity measurements and head observations by incorporating the different data types into the procedure sequentially. Results show that head observations are more effective in reducing the spread of the predictive capture zone distribution, whereas the transmissivity measurements are more valuable in predicting the actual location of the true capture zone.},

   abstract = {Flow path delineation is a valuable tool for interpreting the subsurface hydrogeochemical environment. Different types of data, such as groundwater flow and transport, inform different aspects of hydrogeologic parameter values (hydraulic conductivity in this case) which, in turn, determine flow paths. This work combines flow and transport information to estimate a unified set of hydrogeologic parameters using the Bayesian geostatistical inverse approach. Parameter flexibility is allowed by using a highly parameterized approach with the level of complexity informed by the data. Despite the effort to adhere to the ideal of minimal a priori structure imposed on the problem, extreme contrasts in parameters can result in the need to censor correlation across hydrostratigraphic bounding surfaces. These partitions segregate parameters into facies associations. With an iterative approach in which partitions are based on inspection of initial estimates, flow path interpretation is progressively refined through the inclusion of more types of data. Head observations, stable oxygen isotopes (18O/16O ratios), and tritium are all used to progressively refine flow path delineation on an isthmus between two lakes in the Trout Lake watershed, northern Wisconsin, United States. Despite allowing significant parameter freedom by estimating many distributed parameter values, a smooth field is obtained.},

Depth-averaged bulk hydraulic conductivity information was available from previous testing. The three methods deconvolute the vertical profile of lateral hydraulic conductivity. A linear generalized covariance function combined with a zoning approach was used to describe structure. Nonnegativity was enforced by using a power transformation. Data screening prior to calculations was critical to obtaining reasonable results, and the quantified uncertainty estimates obtained by the inverse method led to the discovery of questionable data at the end of the process. The best estimates obtained using the inverse method and kriging compared favorably with first-difference confirmatory calculations, and all three methods were consistent with the geology at the site.},

   abstract = {Reactive transport modeling is often used in support of bioremediation and chemical treatment planning and design. There remains a pressing need for practical and efficient models that do not require ( or assume attainable) the high level of characterization needed by complex numerical models. We focus on a linear systems or transfer function approach to the problem of reactive tracer transport in a heterogeneous saprolite aquifer. Transfer functions are obtained through the Bayesian geostatistical inverse method applied to tracer injection histories and breakthrough curves. We employ nonparametric transfer functions, which require minimal assumptions about shape and structure. The resulting flexibility empowers the data to determine the nature of the transfer function with minimal prior assumptions. Nonnegativity is enforced through a reflected Brownian motion stochastic model. The inverse method enables us to quantify uncertainty and to generate conditional realizations of the transfer function. Complex information about a hydrogeologic system is distilled into a relatively simple but rigorously obtained function that describes the transport behavior of the system between two wells. The resulting transfer functions are valuable in reactive transport models based on traveltime and streamline methods. The information contained in the data, particularly in the case of strong heterogeneity, is not overextended but is fully used. This is the first application of Bayesian geostatistical inversion to transfer functions in hydrogeology but the methodology can be extended to any linear system.},

   volume = {42},
   number = {3},
   abstract = {We study three-dimensional steady state flow field generated by a fully penetrating well extracting a constant water discharge from a confined aquifer of constant thickness. The hydraulic conductivity K is modeled as an axisymmetric, stationary random space function, and the flow equation is solved by using the seven-node finite volume numerical scheme. In view of application in aquifer characterization we analyze how the equivalent conductivity K-eq varies as a function of the distance from the extraction well. The numerical simulations showed that the boundary condition at the well exerts a large impact on K-eq and that the first-order solution in sigma(Y)2 obtained by Indelman et al. (1996) is valid up to sigma(2)(Y) = 0.5. For higher values of sigma(2)(Y) the first-order solution overestimates K-eq with differences that for a given sigma(2)(Y), reduce progressively as the formation becomes more anisotropic. A simple inverse procedure based on K-eq, obtained through cross-well interference, is finally proposed and tested with the objective of estimating the parameters of the geostatistical model of variability of the hydraulic conductivity. A few parametric examples showed that a suitable interpretation of pumping tests can be used to safely estimate parameters such as the geometric mean of the hydraulic conductivity, its variance, and, although with larger uncertainty, the horizontal integral scale, while the inference of the anisotropy ratio is highly uncertain and error prone.},

Sensitivity analysis required only 71 model runs, and regression required about 50 model runs. The approach presented appears to be ideal for evaluation of models with long run times or as a preliminary step to more computationally demanding methods. The statistics used include composite scaled sensitivities, parameter correlation coefficients, leverage, Cook's D, and DFBETAS. Tests suggest predictive ability of the calibrated model typical of hydrologic models.},

   abstract = {In the design of new waste-management facilities, or in the remedial design for contaminated facilities, there are economic tradeoffs possible between the resources assigned to site investigation, facility design, and site monitoring. Hydrogeological decision analysis provides a framework that allows a sequential, iterative approach to design, in which data acquisition through site investigation alternates with economic analysis of alternative design options. In this framework, the purpose of collecting hydrogeological data is to aid in the making of decisions between the alternative design options. Such decisions are made on the basis of a risk-cost-benefit objective function. Additional measurements have worth only if the risk reduction they provide exceeds the cost of obtaining them. The location of measurement points in a site-investigation network should minimize economic regret with respect to design decisions. This paper provides an introduction to the concepts of data-worth analysis for two cases: (1) the reduction of uncertainty in aquitard continuity, and (2) the reduction of uncertainty in hydraulic-conductivity distribution in an aquifer. It is shown how the use of search theory and Bayesian updating can be applied in comparing prior and preposterior analyses to provide a stopping rule for the collection of additional data in site investigation programs at a hypothetical landfill site.},

   abstract = {Errors arising from the imperfect mathematical representation of the structure of a hydrologic system (model error) are not random but systematic. Their effect on model predictions varies in space and time and differs for the flow and solute transport components of a groundwater model. Such errors do not necessarily have any probabilistic properties that can be easily exploited in the construction of a model performance criterion. A Bayesian approach is presented for quantifying model error in the presence of parameter uncertainty. Insight gained in updating the prior information on the model parameters is used to assess the correctness of the model structure, which is defined relative to the accuracy required of the model predictions. Model error is evaluated for each measurement of the dependent variable through an examination of the correctness of the model structure for different accuracy levels. The effect of model error on each dependent variable, which is quantified as a function of location and time, represents a measure of the reliability of the model in terms of each model prediction. This method can be used in identifying possible causes of model error and in discriminating among models in terms of the correctness of the model structure. It also offers an improved description of the uncertainties associated with a modeling exercise that may be useful in risk assessments and decision analyses.},

The classical single-objective formulation of the inverse problem by its nature cannot capture these characteristics of model error. We introduce an inverse approach that allows the spatial and temporal variability of model error to be evaluated in the parameter space. A set of solutions for model parameters are obtained by this new method that almost exactly satisfies the model equation at each observation point (per-datum calibration). This set of parameter estimates are then used to define a posterior parameter space that may be translated into a probabilistic description of model output to represent the level of confidence in model performance.

   title = {Parameter interdependence and uncertainty induced by lumping in a hydrologic model},
   journal = {Water Resources Research},
   volume = {43},
   number = {5},
   abstract = {[1] Throughout the world, watershed modeling is undertaken using lumped parameter hydrologic models that represent real-world processes in a manner that is at once abstract, but nevertheless relies on algorithms that reflect real-world processes and parameters that reflect real-world hydraulic properties. In most cases, values are assigned to the parameters of such models through calibration against flows at watershed outlets. One criterion by which the utility of the model and the success of the calibration process are judged is that realistic values are assigned to parameters through this process. This study employs regularization theory to examine the relationship between lumped parameters and corresponding real-world hydraulic properties. It demonstrates that any kind of parameter lumping or averaging can induce a substantial amount of "structural noise,'' which devices such as Box-Cox transformation of flows and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) modeling of residuals are unlikely to render homoscedastic and uncorrelated. Furthermore, values estimated for lumped parameters are unlikely to represent average values of the hydraulic properties after which they are named and are often contaminated to a greater or lesser degree by the values of hydraulic properties which they do not purport to represent at all. As a result, the question of how rigidly they should be bounded during the parameter estimation process is still an open one.},

   abstract = {[1] Recirculating well systems provide an engine for the in situ treatment of subsurface contaminants. Although numerous recirculating wells have been installed in the field, for such systems, there is a paucity of comprehensive monitoring data and models constrained to data appearing in the research literature. Here we present an extensive data set combined with detailed inverse and simulation analyses for a two-well groundwater recirculation system used for in situ bioremediation at Edwards Air Force Base in southern California. The "conveyor belt'' flow system, which was established for in situ treatment of trichloroethylene (TCE) in two bioactive zones, was created by pumping water upward in one well and downward in another well, each well being screened in both the upper and lower aquifers. A bromide tracer test was conducted and extensively monitored for 60 days. Combined inverse analysis was conducted on hydraulic heads from 38 monitoring wells, 32 bromide concentration histories, and a constraint on the degree of recirculation that was based on TCE concentration data. Four different formulations involving alternative weighting schemes used in a nonlinear weighted least squares simulation-regression analysis were explored. The best formulation provided parameter estimates with tight bounds on estimated covariances, suggesting that the model provides a reasonable description of the hydrogeologic system. Our investigation indicates the geometry of the recirculation zone and the degree of recirculation under two different sets of operating conditions. Surprisingly, our analysis suggests that the effects of aquifer heterogeneity are not significant at this site under the conditions of forced recirculation. Furthermore, anomalous flow through an open monitoring well created significant vertical short-circuiting between the generally insulated aquifers. Flow through this small open conduit was equivalent to as much as 33% of the flow through the pumping wells. Using the model as a guide, we treated the aquifer system and bioactive zones as an equivalent mixed reactor to develop simple expressions relating effluent concentrations to influent concentrations. We demonstrate how these expressions are useful in predicting the removal of TCE that had undergone in situ bioremediation in the recirculatory treatment well system. The finite element model developed in this work serves as the foundation for a reactive transport simulator that we developed to analyze bioremediation which occurred during a 444 day experiment [Gandhi et al., 2002].},

   abstract = {The representation of subsurface flow and reactive transport as an ensemble of one-dimensional stream tubes is extended to account for nonlinear biodegradation with coupled microbial growth. The stochastic-convective reaction (SCR) model is derived for bioreaction of a single solute by a single class of microorganisms coupled with dynamic microbial growth. A new global variable, the integral of the solute degraded per unit length of system traversed, accounts for degradation. Dimensionless scaling and the method of characteristics are used to reduce the model, written for a single convecting reactor (stream tube), to a pair of coupled nonlinear functional equations for solute concentration and microbial biomass. Existence of a solution to the stream tube system is shown, both numerical and approximate analytical approaches to the solution are given, and example computations using both methods are presented. Conditions under which the stream tube solution is ''canonical,'' or scalable to fit any permissible stream tube travel time function, arise from requirements for invariance (over the stream tube ensemble) of effective one-dimensional stream tubes used to represent transport along real stream tubes in three-dimensional space. Averaging of the stream tube solution over travel time and reaction properties representative of physical and chemical heterogeneities is described as a way to separate and upscale the processes of macrodispersion and microbiological reaction. The approach is exercised to simulate Monte Carlo average behavior of bioreactive transport in physically heterogeneous two-dimensional media. Results show that the method captures the ensemble average large-scale effects of the nonlinear reactions more accurately than done in the classical reactive convection-dispersion equation (CDR), even when the appropriate scale dependent dispersion coefficient is afforded to the CDR.},

   abstract = {For two-dimensional groundwater flow in an isotropic confined aquifer, it has been shown elsewhere that two independent steady state sets of data, i.e., piezometric heads and source terms corresponding to different steady state flow conditions, and the value of transmissivity at one point suffice to determine transmissivity uniquely in a connected domain. The data are independent if the hydraulic gradients are not parallel anywhere over the domain. Here transmissivity is numerically determined by integration of suitably approximated functions of the data along polygonal lines connecting the nodes of a lattice; integration starts from the node where transmissivity is given. The choice of the integration path is based on the results of the stability analysis and allows us to minimize the effects of the approximations on the data. Since the approximated solution is computed along internode segments, the internode transmissivities are immediately calculated without introducing arbitrary averages of the node transmissivities. The internode transmissivities are the quantities necessary to set up a management model within a conservative finite differences scheme. The applicability of this technique to real cases is tested with two synthetic examples. The first one was set up by ourselves, whereas the second one has been taken from the literature. The internode transmissivities identified with our procedure are compared with the synthetic reference ones. The ultimate check is performed of evaluating new head fields on the basis of the identified and reference internode transmissivities. The fit is good. The relative error for the identified internode transmissivities is very low when error-free data are used, and it varies by an amount approximately constant over the entire aquifer when an error on the initial value of transmissivity is introduced. The errors on the piezometric heads bear more relevance, but nonetheless, the affected results are still good.},

   abstract = {A computationally efficient method to estimate the variance and covariance in piezometric head results computed through MODFLOW 2000 using a first-order second moment (FOSM) approach is presented. This methodology employs a first-order Taylor series expansion to combine model sensitivity with uncertainty in geologic data. MODFLOW 2000 is used to calculate both the ground water head and the sensitivity of head to changes in input data. From a limited number of samples, geologic data are extrapolated and their associated uncertainties are computed through a conditional probability calculation. Combining the spatially related sensitivity and input uncertainty produces the variance-covariance matrix, the diagonal of which is used to yield the standard deviation in MODFLOW 2000 head. The variance in piezometric head can be used for calibrating the model, estimating confidence intervals, directing exploration, and evaluating the reliability of a design. A case study illustrates the approach, where aquifer transmissivity is the spatially related uncertain geologic input data. The FOSM methodology is shown to be applicable for calculating output uncertainty for (1) spatially related input and output data, and (2) multiple input parameters (transmissivity and recharge).},

   journal = {Water Resources Research},
   volume = {45},
   abstract = {The objective of this study is to evaluate the pattern and rate of groundwater discharge in a large, regulated fractured rock watershed using novel and standard methods that are independent of base flow recession. Understanding the rate and pattern of groundwater discharge to surface water bodies is critical for watershed budgets, as a proxy for recharge rates, and for protecting the ecological integrity of lake and river ecosystems. The Tay River is a low-gradient, warm-water river that flows over exposed and fractured bedrock or a thin veneer of coarse-grained sediments. Natural conservative (delta H-2, delta O-18, Cl, and specific conductance), radioactive (Rn-222), and thermal tracers are integrated with streamflow measurements and a steady state advective model to delimit the discharge locations and quantify the discharge fluxes to lakes, wetlands, creeks, and the Tay River. The groundwater discharge rates to most surface water body types are low, indicating that the groundwater and surface water system may be largely decoupled in this watershed compared to watersheds underlain by porous media. Groundwater discharge is distributed across the watershed rather than localized around lineaments or high-density zones of exposed brittle fractures. The results improve our understanding of the rate, localization, and conceptualization of discharge in a large, fractured rock watershed. Applying hydraulic, isotopic, or chemical hydrograph separation techniques would be difficult because the groundwater discharge "signal" is small compared to the "background" surface water inflows or volumes of the surface water bodies. Although this study focuses on a large watershed underlain by fractured bedrock, the methodology developed is transferable to any large regulated or unregulated watershed. The low groundwater discharge rates have significant implications for the ecology, sustainability, and management of large, crystalline watersheds.},

   abstract = {Cumulative distribution functions (cdf) of groundwater model responses are generally determined using Monte Carlo analysis. The procedure consists of (1) generating a number of realizations of the parameters controlling groundwater flow, (2) solving the groundwater flow equation in each of the realizations to obtain the model responses, (3) ranking the model responses, and (4) assigning a probability to each model response as a function of its rank and the total number of realizations. When one is only interested in determining one of the tails of the cdf, e.g., to determine model responses with a small probability of being exceeded, it would be more appropriate to try to reverse steps 2 and 3 above, so that the realizations are ranked first and then the groundwater flow equation is solved only for those realizations leading to responses in the tail of the cdf. Because the ranking of the realizations must be done in terms of their model responses, which calls for the solution of the groundwater flow equation, we propose to use a linear approximation of the flow equation to approximate the ranks. The proposal is based on the conjecture that first-order approximations are more robust for computing the ranks of the piezometric heads than for computing the heads themselves. The conjecture is demonstrated in two two-dimensional confined flow problems comparing the results of the approximation to the results of full Monte Carlo analyses on several sets of 200 realizations with varying standard deviations of log10 T.},

   abstract = {A groundwater management model has been developed that predicts human health risks and uses a noisy genetic algorithm to identify promising risk-based corrective action (RBCA) designs. Noisy genetic algorithms are simple genetic algorithms that operate in noisy environments. The noisy genetic algorithm uses a type of noisy fitness function (objective function) called the sampling fitness function, which utilises Monte-Carlo-type sampling to find robust designs. Unlike Monte Carlo simulation modelling, however, the noisy genetic algorithm is highly efficient and can identify robust designs with only a few samples per design. For hydroinformatic problems with complex fitness functions, however, it is important that the sampling be as efficient as possible. In this paper, methods for identifying efficient sampling strategies are investigated and their performance evaluated using a case study of a RBCA design problem. Guidelines for setting the parameter values used in these methods are also developed. Applying these guidelines to the case study resulted in highly efficient sampling strategies that found RBCA designs with 98% reliability using as few as 4 samples per design. Moreover, these designs were identified with fewer simulation runs than would likely be required to identify designs using trial-and-error Monte Carlo simulation. These findings show considerable promise for applying these methods to complex hydroinformatic problems where substantial uncertainty exists but extensive sampling cannot feasibly be done.},

   abstract = {Geostatistical inverse modeling has been shown to be a viable alternative to synthesis Bayesian methods for estimating global continental-scale CO2 fluxes. This study extends the geostatistical approach to take advantage of spatially and temporally varying auxiliary data sets related to CO2 flux processes, which allow the inversion to capture more grid-scale flux variability and better constrain fluxes in areas undersampled by the current atmospheric monitoring network. Auxiliary variables are selected for inclusion in the inversion using a hypothesis-based variable selection method, and are then used in conjunction with atmospheric CO2 measurements to estimate global monthly fluxes for 1997 to 2001 at a 3.75 degrees x 5 degrees resolution. Results show that the inversion is able to infer realistic relationships between the selected variables and flux, with leaf area index and the fraction of canopy-intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR) capturing a large portion of the biospheric signal, and gross domestic product and population densities explaining approximately three quarters of the expected fossil fuel emissions signal. The extended model is able to better constrain estimates in regions with sparse measurements, as confirmed by a reduction in the a posteriori uncertainty at the grid and aggregated continental scales, as compared to the inversion presented in the companion paper (Mueller et al., 2008).},

   abstract = {We consider the dispersion and elution of colloids and dissolved nonsorbing tracers within saturated heterogeneous porous media. Since flow path geometry in natural systems is often ill-characterized macroscopic (mean) flow rates and dispersion tensors are utilized in order to account for the sub-model scale microscopic fluctuations in media structure (and the consequent hydrodynamic profile). Even for tracer migration and dispersal this issue is far from settled. Here we consider how colloid and tracer migration phenomena can be treated consistently. Theoretical calculations for model flow geometries yield two quantitative predictions for the transport of free (not yet captured) colloids with reference to a non-sorbing dissolved tracer within the same medium: the average migration velocity of the free colloids is higher than that of the tracer; and that the ratio of the equivalent hydrodynamic dispersion rates of colloids and tracer is dependent only upon properties of the colloids and the porous medium, it is independent of pathlengths and fluid flux, once length scales are large enough. The first of these is well known, since even in simple flow paths free colloids must stay more centre stream. The second, if validated suggests how solute and colloid dispersion may be dealt with consistently in macroscopic migration models. This is crucial since dispersion is usually ill-characterized and unaddressed by the experimental literature. In this paper we present evidence based upon an existing Drigg field injection test for the validity of these predictions. We show that starting from experimental data the fitted dispersion rates of both colloids and non-sorbing tracers increase with the measured elution rates (obeying slightly different rules for tracers and colloids); and that the ratio of colloid and nonsorbing tracer elution rates, and the ratio of colloid and nonsorbing tracer dispersion rates may be dependent upon properties of the colloids and the medium (not the flow regime). It is important to realize that even for unretarded species, an earlier peak in the breakthrough curve does not necessarily correspond to a faster mean elution rate, or vice versa. But rather that a colloid may elute faster but disperse less than an equivalent tracer. Hence its peak may be retarded compared to that of the tracer, even assuming no retardation. Hence one must consider a combination of mean elution rate and mean dispersion rate, and not rely on "peak times" to corroborate chromatographic effects. The importance of this lies in the fact that these processes are not independent and yet upscale differently. Thus realistic estimates of effective colloid dispersion rates should be upscaled in a way consistent with that adopted for tracers within the same system.},

   abstract = {A new formulation of the element-free Galerkin (EFG) method is presented in this paper. EFG has been extensively popularized in the literature in recent years due to its flexibility and high convergence rate in solving boundary value problems. However, accurate imposition of essential boundary conditions in the EFG method often presents difficulties because the Kronecker delta property, which is satisfied by finite element shape functions, does not necessarily hold for the EFG shape function. The proposed new formulation of EFG eliminates this shortcoming through the moving kriging (MK) interpolation. Two major properties of the MK interpolation: the Kronecker delta property (phi(I)(s(J)) = delta(IJ)) and the consistency property (Sigma(I)(n)phi(I)(x) = 1 and Sigma(I)(n)phi(I)(x)x(Ii) = x(i)) are proved.

   abstract = {The design of a pump-and-treat groundwater remediation system can be solved as an optimization problem. A common approach in this formulation is to minimize the total cost of the pump-and-treat system, while defining the locations and extraction or injection rates of the candidate pumping wells as continuous decision variables. With this choice, the degree of freedom added to the optimization problem yields significant improvements on the solution. In this approach coupled solution of groundwater simulation models and optimization algorithms are required. The repeated use of the groundwater simulation models throughout the optimization cycle tends to be numerically complex and computationally costly when the governing equations are nonlinear. To overcome this drawback, we propose a new computational procedure, identified as progressive genetic algorithm (PGA), to solve the optimal design problem. PGA is a subdomain method, which combines standard genetic algorithm with ground water simulation models in an iterative solution process and provides a powerful tool for the solution of highly nonlinear optimization problems. Numerical examples are included to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Applications indicate that the proposed approach provides a feasible alternative for the solution of nonlinear optimization problems in groundwater management.},

   abstract = {A probabilistic model of groundwater contaminant transport is presented. The model is based on coupling first- and second-order reliability methods (FORM and SORM) with a two-dimensional finite element solution of groundwater transport equations. Uncertainty in aquifer media is considered by modeling hydraulic conductivity as a spatial random held with a prescribed correlation structure. FORM and SORM provide the probability that a contaminant exceeds a target level at a well, termed the probability of failure. Sensitivity of the probability of failure to basic variabilities in grid block conductivity is also obtained, at no additional computational effort. The effect of the choice of the predetermined target level at the observation well is provided, along with its effect on the relevant sensitivity information. Considerable saving in computational time was achieved by superimposing a coarse random variables mesh on a finer numerical mesh. The presence of regions of lower conductivity on the probabilistic event is analyzed, and the regions in which conductivity most affects the results are identified.

Estimates of this type are established in the second part of the paper for ill-posed parameter identification problems arising in inverse groundwater hydrology. Both transient and steady-state data are investigated. Finally, the numerical performance of the new Levenberg-Marquardt scheme is studied and compared to a usual implementation on a realistic but synthetic two-dimensional model problem from the engineering literature.

The corresponding computational problem takes the form of structured matrix problem with a Toeplitz or block Toeplitz coefficient matrix. The aim of this paper is to present a tutorial survey of numerical algorithms for the practical treatment of these discretized deconvolution problems, with emphasis on methods that take the special structure of the matrix into account. Wherever possible, analogies to classical DFT-based deconvolution problems are drawn. Among other things, we present direct methods for regularization with Toeplitz matrices, and we show how Toeplitz matrix-vector products are computed by means of FFT, being useful in iterative methods. We also introduce the Kronecker product and show how it is used in the discretization and solution of 2-D deconvolution problems whose variables separate. (35 refs.)},

   abstract = {This paper presents an efficient trajectory-based approach to integrate transient pressure data into high-resolution reservoir and aquifer models. The method involves alternating traveltime and peak amplitude matching of pressure response using inverse modeling and is particularly well suited for high-resolution subsurface characterization using hydraulic tomography or pressure interference tests. Compared to traveltime inversion only, our proposed approach results in a significantly improved match of the pressure response at the wells and also better estimates of subsurface properties. This is accomplished with very little increase in computational cost. Utilizing the concept of a "diffusive" time of flight derived from an asymptotic solution of the diffusivity equation, we develop analytical approaches to estimate the sensitivities for traveltime and peak amplitude of pressure response to subsurface properties. The sensitivities are then used in an iterative least squares minimization to match the pressure data. We illustrate our approach using synthetic and field examples. In the field application at a fractured limestone formation the predominant fracture patterns emerging from the inversion are shown to be consistent with independent geophysical experiments and borehole data.},

   abstract = {There often is difficulty enforcing the given constraints when applying a genetic algorithm (a flexible stochastic search method) to optimal ground-water remediation design problems. This paper compares two methods for constraint handling within the genetic algorithm framework. The first method, the additive penalty method (APM), is a commonly used penalty function approach in which a penalty cost proportional to the total constraints violation is added to the objective function. The second method, the multiplicative penalty method (MPM), multiplies the objective function by a factor proportional to the total constraints violation. The APM and MPM, using constant and generation-varying constraint weights, are applied to two pump-and-treat design examples. Overall, the application of the APM resulted in infeasible solutions with small-to-moderate total constraints violations. With the MPM, a set of feasible and near-optimal policies was readily identified for both examples. Additionally, the MPM converges to the solution faster than the APM. These results demonstrate that the MPM is a robust method, capable of finding feasible and optimal or near-optimal solutions while using a range of weights.},

   abstract = {A new optimization formulation for dynamic groundwater remediation management is developed by simultaneously using well locations and the corresponding pumping rates as the decision variables. The genetic algorithm is applied to search for optimal pumping rates and the discrete space of well locations. The optimization model is applied to hypothetical, three-dimensional, contaminated aquifer systems with homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media properties. Optimal well locations and pumping rates obtained with the moving-well model are less expensive than solutions obtained with a comparable fixed-well. model. Optimization with a linear objective function formulation identifies some of the optimal well locations obtained with a nonlinear formulation but results in higher pumping rates than the nonlinear formulation and ignores the higher drawdowns produced in low-permeability areas. Optimal well locations are found along the mass centerline of the contaminant plumes and in high-permeability areas in the heterogeneous system. Dynamic pumping rates and well locations produce more cost-effective solutions relative to a static model. The well location search path and convergence behavior indicate that the genetic algorithm is an effective alternative solution scheme and that well location optimization is more important than pumping rate optimization.},

   abstract = {Subsurface environmental, engineering, and agricultural investigations often require characterization of hydraulic parameters. For example, groundwater flow modeling is often performed through an aquifer whose hydrological properties have been created using stochastic simulation techniques; these techniques use as input both hydraulic parameter point values and spatial correlation structure information. Conventional sampling or borehole techniques for measuring these parameters are costly, time-consuming, and invasive. Geophysical data can compliment direct characterization data by providing multi-dimensional and high resolution subsurface measurements in a minimally invasive manner. Several techniques have been developed in the preceding decade for using joint geophysical-hydrological data to characterize the subsurface; the purpose of this study is to review three methodologies that we have recently developed for use with geophysical-hydrological data to estimate hydrological parameters and their spatial correlation structures. The first two methodologies presented focus on producing high-resolution estimates of hydrological properties using densely sampled geophysical data and limited borehole data. Although we find that high-resolution geophysical data are useful for obtaining these estimates, in practice, geophysical profiles often sample only a small portion of the aquifer under investigation, and thus, the estimates obtained from geophysical data may not be sufficient to completely describe the hydraulic properties of the aquifer volume. The third and last section focuses on using high-resolution tomographic data together with limited borehole data to infer the spatial correlation structure of log-permeability, which can be used within stochastic simulation techniques to generate parameter estimates at unsampled locations. Our synthetic case studies suggest that collection of a few tomographic profiles and interpretation of these profiles together with limited wellbore data can yield hydrological point values and spatial correlation structure information that can be used to aid numerical aquifer model construction, calibration, and flow simulation. As this information is typically only obtainable from extensive hydrological sampling, use of geophysical methods may offer a more efficient and less invasive approach than traditional characterization campaigns.},

Geochemical, hydrological and geophysical data were collected to characterize the site prior to performing several bromide and bacterial tracer test experiments. The first part of the talk will focus on results of the characterization effort at the site performed using hydrological and geophysical data collected across a range of spatial scales, including surface ground penetrating radar (GPR), radar crosshole tomography, seismic crosshole tomography, cone penetrometer (CPT) and borehole electromagnetic flowmeter. These interpreted data were used to constrain the numerical flow and transport models, as well as to reduce the ambiguity often associated with interpretation of field-scale transport experiments due to uncertainties about subsurface physical heterogeneities. Another aspect that we are interested in is the spatio-temporal link between the microbial, hydrological, and physical parameters. Permeability reductions of up to three orders of magnitude have been noted by other researchers during bacterial growth as a result of the formation of a biofilm on the outer surfaces of porous grains, the formation of bacterial aggregates that accumulate and plug pore constrictions, and pore-clogging biogenic gas production. The second part of the talk will focus on efforts that are currently underway at the Oyster Site to investigate the utility of geophysical methods for monitoring physical property variations in porous media caused by bacterial-related phenomena during a biostimulation experiment.},

   abstract = {Analyses of study variables are frequently based on log transformations. To calculate the power for detecting the between-treatment difference in the log scale, we need an estimate of the standard deviation of the log-transformed variable. However, in many situations a literature search only provides the arithmetic means and the corresponding standard deviations. Without individual log-transformed data to directly calculate the sample standard deviation, we need alternative methods to estimate it. This paper presents methods for estimating and constructing confidence intervals for the standard deviation of a log-transformed variable given the mean and standard deviation of the untransformed variable. It also presents methods for estimating the standard deviation of change from baseline in the log scale given the means and standard deviations of the untransformed baseline value, on-treatment value and change from baseline. Simulations and examples are provided to assess the performance of these estimates. Copyright 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

   abstract = {As part of the USGS Water, Energy, and Biogeochemical Budgets project and the NSF Long-Term Ecological Research work, a parameter estimation code was used to calibrate a deterministic groundwater flow model of the Trout Lake Basin in northern Wisconsin. Observations included traditional calibration targets (head, lake stage, and baseflow observations) as well as unconventional targets such as groundwater flows to and from lakes, depth of a lake water plume, and time of travel. The unconventional data types were important for parameter estimation convergence and allowed the development of a more detailed parameterization capable of resolving model objectives with well-constrained parameter values. Independent estimates of groundwater inflow to lakes were most important for constraining lakebed leakance and the depth of the lake water plume was important for determining hydraulic conductivity and conceptual aquifer layering. The most important target overall, however, was a conventional regional baseflow target that led to correct distribution of flow between sub-basins and the regional system during model calibration. The use of an automated parameter estimation code: (1) facilitated the calibration process by providing a quantitative assessment of the model's ability to match disparate observed data types; and (2) allowed assessment of the influence of observed targets on the calibration process. The model calibration required the use of a 'universal' parameter estimation code in order to include all types of observations in the objective function. The methods described in this paper help address issues of watershed complexity and non-uniqueness common to deterministic watershed models. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Approaches for modeling lake-ground water interactions have evolved significantly from early simulations that used fixed lake stages specified as constant head to sophisticated LAK packages for MODFLOW. Although model input can be complex, the LAK package capabilities and output are superior to methods that rely on a fixed lake stage and compare well to other simple methods where lake stage can be calculated. Regardless of the approach, guidelines presented here for model grid size, location of three-dimensional flow, and extent of vertical capture can facilitate the construction of appropriately detailed models that simulate important lake-ground water interactions without adding unnecessary complexity. In addition to MODFLOW approaches, lake simulation has been formulated in terms of analytic elements. The analytic element lake package had acceptable agreement with a published LAK1 problem, even though there were differences in the total lake conductance and number of layers used in the two models. The grid size used in the original LAK1 problem, however, violated a grid size guideline presented in this paper. Grid sensitivity analyses demonstrated that an appreciable discrepancy in the distribution of stream and lake flux was related to the large grid size used in the original LAK1 problem. This artifact is expected regardless of MODFLOW LAK package used. When the grid size was reduced, a finite-difference formulation approached the analytic element results. These insights and guidelines can help ensure that the proper lake simulation tool is being selected and applied. (35 Refs.)},

   abstract = {Pretty Lake is a 64 acre, sandy-bottomed ground water flow-through lake that has a history of hydrologic disturbance. Residents and regulators require a better understanding of lake-groundwater interaction to develop measures to protect the lake's hydrologic system and water quality. A groundwater flow model was constructed as a tool to synthesize field data collected at the site, delineate recharge areas that supply groundwater to the lake, and predict the effect of dredging an adjacent drainage ditch. The one layer, two-dimensional steady-state area) model used analytic element (AE) methods because they are quick to apply and include sophisticated simulation of groundwater-surface water interaction. The model calibrated well to groundwater heads (mean absolute difference - 0.05 m), lake stage (within 0.05 m) and ditch fluxes (mean absolute difference -0.0023 m-3 cntdot s-1). Model results showed that a single 1000 m wide recharge area supplies all the groundwater inflow to the lake. In addition, the model predicted that dredging an adjacent ditch by 3.0 m would lower the lake level by 0.31 m. The analytic element model was verified using a widely accepted finite-difference (FD) code; differences were less than +- 0.01 5 m near the lake area and reached a maximum of 0.08 m at far corners of the FD grid. These differences are likely a result of the nodal interpolation inherent to FD techniques and error associated with applying a discrete boundary to the AE infinite aquifer. Although developed recently, AE methods have great potential to aid characterizations of groundwater-lake systems.},

   abstract = {Recharge areas of spring systems can be hard to identify, but they can be critically important for protection of a spring resource. A recharge area for a spring complex in southern Wisconsin was delineated using a variety of complementary techniques. A telescopic mesh refinement (TMR) model was constructed from an existing regional-scale ground water flow model. This TMR model was formally optimized using parameter estimation techniques; the optimized "best fit" to measured heads and fluxes was obtained by using a horizontal hydraulic conductivity 200% larger than the original regional model for the upper bedrock aquifer and 80% smaller for the lower bedrock aquifer. The uncertainty in hydraulic conductivity was formally considered using a stochastic Monte Carlo approach. Two-hundred model runs used uniformly distributed, randomly sampled, horizontal hydraulic conductivity values within the range given by the TMR optimized values and the previously constructed regional model. A probability distribution of particles captured by the spring, or a "probabilistic capture zone," was calculated from the realistic Monte Carlo results (136 runs of 200). In addition to portions of the local surface watershed, the capture zone encompassed areas outside of the watershed - demonstrating that the ground watershed and surface watershed do not coincide. Analysis of water collected from the site identified relatively large contrasts in chemistry, even for springs within 15 m of one another. The differences showed a distinct gradation from Ordovician-carbonate-dominated water in western spring vents to Cambrian-sandstone-influenced water in eastern spring vents. The difference in chemistry was attributed to distinctive bedrock geology as demonstrated by overlaying the capture zone derived from numerical modeling over a bedrock geology map for the area. This finding gives additional confidence to the capture zone calculated by modeling. (45 Refs.)},

The local equilibrium model and the segregated flow model approximate the retardation of organic chemicals but do not account for the amount of spreading seen in the breakthrough and elution data. A dispersed flow, local equilibrium model (DFLEM) could simulate the breakthrough of the organic chemicals and tracer but only if the axial dispersion coefficient were adjusted to match the breakthrough data. Existing correlations for axial dispersion based on soil and fluid properties could not predict the apparent dispersion seen in the miscible displacement experiments. A dispersed flow, pore and surface diffusion model (DFPSDM) could also simulate the chemical breakthrough if an aggregate radius were adjusted to fit the data. Neither the adjusted radii nor the apparent dispersivities could be related to the hydraulic characteristics of the column or to soil properties. Both models were able to reasonably predict the elution of chemical from the column when either an aggregate radius or an apparent dispersivity were estimated from the breakthrough data. While the DFPSDM appears to be more phenomenologically correct, this work suggests that an additional kinetic mechanism should be included in the model.-- Modified journal abstract.},

The model is designed for practical application to a wide variety of contamination and remediation scenarios involving light or dense NAPL's in heterogeneous subsurface systems. The model formulation is first derived for three-phase flow of water, NAPL and air (or vapor) in porous media. The formulation is then extended to handle fractured systems using the dual-porosity and discrete-fracture modeling approaches The model accommodates a wide variety of boundary conditions, including withdrawal and injection well conditions which are treated rigorously using fully implicit schemes. The three-phase formulation collapses to its simpler forms when air-phase dynamics are neglected, capillary effects are neglected, or two-phase air-liquid, liquid-liquid systems with one or two active phases are considered. A Galerkin procedure with upstream weighting of fluid mobilities, storage matrix lumping, and fully implicit treatment of nonlinear coefficients and well conditions is used. A variety of nodal connectivity schemes leading to finite-difference, finite-element and hybrid spatial approximations in three dimensions are incorporated in the formulation. Selection of primary variables and evaluation of the terms of the Jacobian matrix for the Newton-Raphson linearized equations is discussed. The various nodal lattice options, and their significance to the computational time and memory requirements with regards to the block-Orthomin solution scheme are noted. Aggressive time-stepping schemes and under-relaxation formulas implemented in the code further alleviate the computational burden.},

Novel aspects of the design are the use of closely spaced wells to recirculate solutes through a biocurtain, well screens spanning the vertical extent of contamination, and a semipassive mode of operation, with only six hours of low-level pumping per week. This design was developed by coupling flow and transport simulations with a cost optimization algorithm, based on initial hydraulic conductivity data and system design constraints from a previous pilot-scale experiment adjacent to the current site. The hydraulic conductivity of the site was characterized using permeameter analysis on more than 200 samples from continuous well cores that were collected during well installation. The subset of available conductivity data was used to predict tracer transport through the biocurtain during system operation. Observed tracer concentration arrival histories during initial system operation confirmed model predictions. Modeling also established that closely spaced wells operated for brief periods each week could effectively deliver the agents needed for remediation across the biocurtain. This was confirmed during long-term operation of the system, which has resulted in highly efficient contamination degradation. The delivery well design methodology is expected to be broadly applicable at other sites where flow can be recirculated between a series of delivery wells. (33 Refs.)},

   abstract = {Cross-well seismic tomography can be used to develop high-resolution seismic slowness (1/velocity) estimates along planes through aquifers. Unfortunately, the relation between seismic slowness and hydraulic conductivity is poorly understood, resulting in poor characterization of hydraulic properties from seismic data. This relation is generally developed from laboratory measurements, but slowness values measured with very high frequencies in the lab are often poorly correlated with lower frequency cross-well and surface seismic slowness values. To address this problem, we developed an approach to infer the relation between slowness and hydraulic conductivity using field scale geophysical and hydrogeologic measurements. We first develop an a priori relation between the conductivity measurements and the cross-well slowness estimates. Multiple three-dimensional slowness realizations, conditioned on the cross-well estimates, are then generated and remapped into log conductivity fields using the a priori slowness to log conductivity relation. We simulate groundwater flow and tracer transport through these conductivity fields and calculate the residuals between measured and simulated concentration arrival time quantiles and drawdown. The slope and intercept of the relation between slowness and log hydraulic conductivity and the dispersivity are then estimated for each slowness realization to minimize the sum of these squared residuals. We demonstrate this approach for the Kesterson aquifer, California, where seismic tomography provided valuable information about aquifer properties. The groundwater flow and tracer transport simulations, through the estimated conductivity fields, yield reasonable fits to the observed tracer concentration histories for two multiple-well tracer tests (one of which was not used in the inversion) and to the measured drawdown. This approach provides estimates of seismic slowness and hydraulic conductivity, and information about the relation between slowness and log conductivity for a field site.},

Its spatial variation is generally agreed within the research community, while the scale effect in permeability is Still under considerable debate. This debate is mainly due to the lack of consistent measurement and interpretation of site data. Here, we show a strong field evidence of directional permeability scale effect from cross-hole pneumatic injection tests conducted in unsaturated fractured tuff at a field site in central Arizona, USA. The analysis reveals that permeability increases with the radial distance measured between the centroids of injection and monitoring locations of the test, which we consider to be the measurement scale. These results are compared to previously analyzed single-hole tests conducted at Multiple measurement scales. We hypothesize that the permeability scale effect is controlled by the connectivity of fluid conducting fractures, which also increases with Scale. This observation and hypothesis is consistent With existing scaling theories in fracture connectivity, although subsurface fracture connectivity cannot be measured directly with present technology. These results suggest the need to obtain permeability estimates that are commensurate with the scale of intended use. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

Parallel to the generation of synthetic data, we conduct hydraulic tests at multiple scales in a laboratory aquifer with deterministic heterogeneity to generate data that are used to validate K tomograms from hydraulic tomography. Measurements include multiple K estimates from core, slug, single-hole and cross-hole tests as well as several unidirectional, flow-through experiments conducted on the sandbox under steady-state conditions. Validation of K tomograms involved a multi-method and multiscale approach proposed herein which include: (1) visual comparisons of K tomograms to the true sand distributions and the reference K tomogram; (2) testing the ability of the K tomogram to predict the hydraulic head distribution of an independent cross-hoLe test not used in the computation of the K tomogram; (3) comparison of the conditional mean and variance of Local K from the K tomograms to the sample mean and variance of results from other measurements; (4) comparison of local K values from K tomograms to those from the reference K tomogram; and (5) comparison of Local K values from K tomograms to those obtained from cores and singte-hole tests. The multi-method and multiscale validation approach proposed herein further illustrates the robustness of steady-state hydraulic tomography in subsurface heterogeneity delineation.

In the absence of added electron donor, NO3-, Tc(VII), and U(VI) reduction was not detectable. However, in the presence of added ethanol, glucose, or acetate to serve as electron donor, rapid NO3- utilization was observed. The accumulation of NO2-, the absence of detectable NH4+ accumulation, and the production of N2O during in situ acetylene-block experiments suggest that NO3- was being consumed via denitrification. Tc(VII) reduction occurred concurrently with NO3- reduction, but U(VI) reduction was not observed until two or more donor additions resulted in iron-reducing conditions, as detected by the production of Fe(II). Reoxidation/remobilization of U(IV) was also observed in tests conducted with high (similar to120 mM) but not low (similar to1 mM) initial NO3- concentrations and not during acetylene-block experiments conducted with high initial NO3-. These results suggest that NO3--dependent microbial U(IV) oxidation may inhibit or reverse U(VI) reduction and decrease the stability of U(IV) in this environment. Changes in viable biomass, community composition, metabolic status, and respiratory state of organisms harvested from down-well microbial samplers deployed during these tests were consistent with the conclusions that electron donor additions resulted in microbial growth, the creation of anaerobic conditions, and an increase in activity of metal-reducing organisms (e.g., Geobacter). The results demonstrate that it is possible to stimulate the simultaneous bioreduction of U(VI) and Tc(VII) mixtures commonly found with NO3- co-contamination at radioactive waste sites.},

   abstract = {A Bayesian decision framework is developed for addressing questions of hydrogeological data worth associated with engineering design at sites in heterogeneous geological environments. The specific case investigated is one of remedial contaminant containment in an aquifer underlain by an aquitard of uncertain continuity. The framework is used to evaluate the worth of hard and soft data in investigating the aquitard's continuity. The analysis consists of four modules: (1) an aquitard realization generator based on indicator kriging, (2) a procedure for the Bayesian updating of the uncertainty with respect to aquitard windows, (3) a Monte Carlo simulation model for advective contaminant transport, and (4) an economic decision model. A sensitivity analysis for a generic design example involving a design decision between a no-action alternative and a containment alternative indicates that the data worth of a single borehole providing a hard point datum was more sensitive to economic parameters than to hydrogeological or geostatistical parameters. For this case, data worth is very sensitive to the projected cost of containment, the discount rate, and the estimated cost of failure. When it comes to hydrogeological parameters, such as the representative hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard or underlying aquifer, the sensitivity analysis indicates that it is more important to know whether the field value is above or below some threshold value than it is to know its actual numerical value. A good conceptual understanding of the site geology is important in estimating prior uncertainties. The framework was applied in a retrospective fashion to the design of a remediation program for soil contaminated by radioactive waste disposal at the Savannah River site in South Carolina. The cost-effectiveness of different patterns of boreholes was studied. A contour map is presented for the net expected value of sample information (EVSI) for a single borehole. The net EVSI of patterns of precise point measurements is also compared to that of an imprecise seismic survey.},

A Bayesian data worth framework is developed in an attempt to carry out this task for remediation programs in which a groundwater contaminant plume must be located and then hydraulically contained. The framework is applied to a hypothetical contamination problem where uncertainty in plume location and extent are caused by uncertainty in source location, source loading time, and aquifer heterogeneity. The goal is to find the optimum number and the best locations for a sequence of observation wells that minimize the expected cost of remediation plus sampling. Simplifying assumptions include steady state heads, advective transport, simple retardation, and remediation costs as a linear function of discharge rate. In the case here, an average of six observation wells was needed. Results indicate that this optimum number was particularly sensitive to the mean hydraulic conductivity. The optimum number was also sensitive to the variance of the hydraulic conductivity, annual discount rate, operating cost, and sample unit cost. It was relatively insensitive to the correlation length of hydraulic conductivity. For the case here, points of greatest uncertainty in plume presence were on average poor candidates for sample locations, and randomly located samples were not cost-effective.},

   abstract = {The mobility of water and solutes in the vadose zone occurs through a complex continuum of pores that vary in size and shape. Fractured subsurface media that have weathered often depict the extreme case of pore-class heterogeneity because highly conductive voids surround low-permeability, high-porosity matrix blocks. In this chapter, the physical and chemical processes controlling water and solute transport in fractured, weathered shales are discussed. At the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), the weathered shales are commonplace and are characterized by a highly interconnected fracture network with densities of 100-200 fractures per meter. The media are conducive to extreme preferential flow that results in physical, hydraulic, and geochemical nonequilibrium conditions between fractures and the surrounding soil matrix. This scenario is of significance with regard to contaminant fate and transport issues at ORNL, where the subsurface burial of toxic metals and radionuclides has occurred. A multiregion flow and transport concept has been adopted to describe the movement of water and solutes through the weathered shale. A variety of multiscale experimental and numerical endeavors have been undertaken to justify the multiregion concept. Experimental manipulations at the laboratory, intermediate, and field scales are designed to quantify the rates and mechanisms of intra-and inter-region mass transfer. These experimental techniques have significantly improved our conceptual understanding of time-dependent solute migration in fractured subsurface media and have also provided the necessary experimental constraints needed for accurate numerical quantification of the physical or geochemical nonequilibrium processes that control solute migration.},

Computation of the correlation dimension of synthetic clean series have been done by Grassberger and Procaccia algorithm and other methods. An efficient method of neighbour search, which can be incorporated with Grassberger and Procaccia algorithm has been proposed. A set of artificially contaminated data sets with different levels of noise were created and different non-linear noise reduction techniques have been employed in these and the hydrometeorological time series. The correlation dimensions of cleaned series have been computed by efficient algorithms. Prediction of different time series was made by both approaches. Prediction accuracies, as well as the results of a test for the existence of determinism point to the conclusion that many of the seemingly stochastic series considered were deterministic.

In order to handle the non-linearity associated with waveform or amplitude beyond the critical slowness, an inversion algorithm based on Bayes' theory is used. A genetic algorithm was used to obtain the a posteriori probability density (PPD) function. The sensitivity analysis is performed on synthetic data containing P-wave as well as converted S-wave reflections. Four different two-layer models, which represent the typical range of AVS responses associated with the gas-sands normally encountered in exploration, were used to examine how well the elastic parameters can be inverted for different parametrizations by comparing the PPD functions. The sensitivity study results suggest that including wide-angle data in the inversion can greatly enhance the quality of inversion. The converted S-wave reflections can provide valuable extra information that can be used to extract elastic parameters. The results with noisy data demonstrate that the contrast of density and three velocity ratios can be estimated robustly with wide-angle reflection data.},

The generalized TFM is shown to be related to the law of mass balance for a solute as interpreted in the context of probability theory. The principal conceptual entity in the TFM is the solute lifetime probability density function. Methodologies for determining this function experimentally are outlined and its relation to the solute travel time density function defined by Jury is shown. Since the generalized TFM is formulated independently of any particular mechanism of solute transport through soil, it is concluded that mechanistic models of solute movement consistent with the law of mass balance are also consistent with the TFM.

Synthetic responses from two different models, which represent typical subsurface structures in the shield areas, were studied. Various models achieved after 10 VFSA runs were used to compute the mean model and the corresponding covariance and correlation matrices which were then used to estimate the uncertainties in the mean model parameters and correlations between the model parameters. An individual inversion of either real or imaginary anomalies cannot yield a model that would fit both observations. However, the joint inversion of the real and imaginary data sets will yield a model, which fits both observations. The models obtained either by the individual or by joint inversion of VLF data do not show good agreement with the VLF-R observations. Generally, the models obtained from VLF inversions show better agreement with the apparent resistivity than with the phase data. Conversely, the joint inversion of the apparent resistivity and phase data yields models which give good agreement with the real and imaginary anomalies. The results obtained after the joint inversion of all the VLF and VLF-R data give good agreement with all the data sets. Individual inversion of any response cannot yield a reliable subsurface structure no matter how well a particular observed response is fitted by the computed responses. Field data from three profiles traversing different geological structures were also inverted to demonstrate the efficacy of the approach for delineating the geometry and properties of 2-D structures. The VLF-R inversions invariably give superior results in comparison with the VLF inversions. However, the most reliable models are obtained from the joint inversion of both VLF and VLF-R data sets.},

   abstract = {A Lagrangian stochastic framework was used to analyze field-scale aerobic biodegradation in a heterogeneous aquifer, using Monod-kinetics based reactions between the contaminant, oxygen and microbes. Subsurface heterogeneity was represented by closed-form travel time distributions, derived from a spatially correlated random hydraulic conductivity field with a log-normal distribution. The solution to the coupled and nonlinear, one-dimensional Lagrangian transport equations was obtained using the operator-splitting technique. The presence of nitrate, and considering nitrate as a second electron acceptor, produced significantly different results under intrinsic conditions for different scales of heterogeneity and sorption. In general, nitrate as a second electron acceptor can substantially lower the peak contaminant concentration and increase the maximum remediation under various conditions of heterogeneity and sorption. There exists a critical value for retardation coefficients of both contaminant and microbes that produce complete degradation of mass, and this value depends on the availability of the electron acceptor(s) and is independent of the heterogeneity. Maximum remediation and peak contaminant concentration were sensitive to half-saturation constants. Enhanced remediation using oxygen and nitrate showed that maximum remediation can be increased by approximately 15% when oxygen or nitrate concentration was increased by 50%, but a further increase may be obtained if injection occurred at a more effective location. The proposed stochastic methodology is capable of analyzing field-scale biodegradation using multiple electron acceptors in a simple and computationally attractive manner, producing useful results on design parameters. The key contributions arising from the Lagrangian stochastic framework in field-scale analysis, its limitations and potential approaches for overcoming these limitations are also discussed.

The purpose is to obtain important petrophysical information, required for petroleum exploration and assessment of barrier quality to contaminant migration. Results indicate that the frr-A relationship for fresh mudrock and mudrock fragments from the saprolite is positive, implying that these Cambrian shales are likely mature and have undergone considerable diagenesis. The mudrock saprolite groundmass samples display a frr-A relationship which is zero to slightly negative, suggesting likely most pore cement has been dissolved to the extent that the original grains have lost most of their cement coating, effectively displaying characteristics of an immature sedimentary rock.},

   abstract = {The availability of powerful desktop computers and graphical user interfaces for ground water flow models makes possible the construction of ever more complex models. A proposed copper-zinc sulfide mine in northern Wisconsin offers a unique case in which the same hydrologic system has been modeled using a variety of techniques covering a wide range of sophistication and complexity. Early in the permitting process, simple numerical models were used to evaluate the necessary amount of water to be pumped from the mine, reductions in streamflow, and the drawdowns in the regional aquifer. More complex models have subsequently been used in an attempt to refine the predictions. Even after so much modeling effort, questions regarding the accuracy and reliability of the predictions remain.  We have performed a new analysis of the proposed mine using the two-dimensional analytic element code GFLOW coupled with the nonlinear parameter estimation code UCODE. The new model is parsimonious, containing fewer than 10 parameters, and covers a region several times larger in areal extent than any of the previous models. The model demonstrates the suitability of analytic element codes for use with parameter estimation codes. The simplified model results are similar to the more complex models; predicted mine inflows and UCODE-derived 95% confidence intervals are consistent with the previous predictions. More important, the large areal extent of the model allowed us to examine hydrological features not included in the previous models, resulting in new insights about the effects that far-field boundary conditions can have on near-field model calibration and parameterization. In this case, the addition of surface water runoff into a lake in the headwaters of a stream while holding recharge constant moved a regional ground watershed divide and resulted in some of the added water being captured by the adjoining basin. Finally, a simple analytical solution was used to clarify the GFLOW model's prediction that, for a model that is properly calibrated for heads, regional drawdowns are relatively unaffected by the choice of aquifer properties, but that mine inflows are strongly affected. Paradoxically, by reducing model complexity, we have increased the understanding gained from the modeling effort.},

Groundwater enters the aquifer mainly as seepage from a dilute lake and evolves chemically under open-CO2 conditions for at least 8 years before discharging to another lake. Spatial trends in the aquifer are evident for calcium, magnesium, silicon, sodium, CO2, alkalinity, pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen. The kinetics of silicate mineral dissolution regulates additions of calcium, magnesium, and alkalinity to the groundwater, causing them to increase steadily along flow paths at about 12-mu-mol L-1 yr-1 (Ca), 6-mu-mol L-1 yr-1 (Mg), and 39-mu-eq L-1 yr-1 (alkalinity) respectively, for at least 3-5 years. Silicon and sodium increase by 41-mu-mol L-1 yr-1 and 13-mu-mol L-1 yr-1 respectively for about 3 years, then level off as the groundwater approaches saturation with respect to kaolinite and smectite.},

Because of the diverse mineral assemblage present and uncertainties in the thermodynamic constants, it is not possible to derive a unique solution. However, considering relative reaction kinetics and mineral abundance, a model involving the dissolution of plagioclase and small amounts of biotite and pyroxene to kaolinite in an open-CO2 system is a simple, thermodynamically valid and reasonable explanation for the major chemical changes. The favored reaction model would result in apparent rates of dissolution of 2 x 10(-18) mol cm-2 s-1 plagioclase (An41), 3 x 10(-20) mol cm-2 s-1 biotite, and 3 x 10(-17) mol cm-2 s-1 diopside. These rates are lower than published rates from laboratory studies, that range from 10(-11) to 10(-17) mol cm-2 s-1 for plagioclase, but are in the same range as rates derived from field studies. In predictive simulations where current silicate dissolution rates are assumed to hold constant but the pH of the recharge water is lowered from 6.4 to 3.99 (simulating increasing acidity of precipitation), the pH and alkalinity of the groundwater are reduced significantly.},

Integrated DAQ parameter estimation systems can be used to reduce data storage requirements, trigger event recognition and more detailed sampling actions, and otherwise enhance remote monitoring capabilities. The contaminant transport problem is posed here as the analogous heat transfer problem in a three-dimensional, intermediate-scale physical aquifer model. A constant source of warm water is fed into a sandy aquifer undergoing steady, unidirectional flow. The spatial distribution of temperature in the medium is monitored over time using 17 thermocouples embedded in the medium. These sensors log temperatures via conventional analog-to-digital conversion hardware driven by commercially available DAQ software (LabVIEW (TM)). Parameter estimation routines programmed in MATLAB (TM)-based M-files are embedded in the LabVIEW DAQ routine and access parameter estimation libraries, such as the descent method employed here, via the Internet. The integrated DAQ parameter estimation system is demonstrated for the estimation of (1) the thermal dispersion coefficients (analogous to mass dispersion coefficients), given a known heat source; and (2) the location of a heat source, given known thermal dispersion coefficients. In both cases, the parameter estimation procedure is executed repeatedly as the data are acquired. For the case of source location, the effect of the number of sensors on the parameter estimation procedure is also demonstrated. Reasonable parameter estimates are provided rapidly during both the transient and steady-state phases of the experiments, with accuracy increasing with time and with the number of observations employed.},

   abstract = {In linear geostatistics, models for the mean function (drift) and the variogram or generalized covariance function are selected on the basis of the modeler's understanding of the phenomenon studied as well as data.  One can seldom be assured that the most appropriate model has been selected; however, analysis of residuals is helpful in diagnosing whether some important characteristic of the data has been neglected and, ultimately, in providing a reasonable degree of assurance that the selected model is consistent with the available information.  The orthonormal residuals presented in this work are kriging errors constructed so that, when the correct model is used, they are uncorrelated and have zero mean and unit variance.  It is suggested that testing of orthonormal residuals is a practical way for evaluating the agreement of the model with the data and for diagnosing model deficiencies.  Their advantages over the usually employed standardized residuals are discussed.  A set of tests are presented.  Orthonormal residuals can also be useful in the estimation of the covariance (or variogram) parameters for a model that is considered correct.},

It is widely accepted now that a well-defined estimate can be obtained only if additional information about the function structure is introduced into the problem formulation. This work presents a method to obtain a stable and reasonable estimate that utilizes only the data and the flow or transport model with the minimum possible suppositions about the unknown function or its structure. The motivation is to develop a solution that has only characteristics that are traced directly to the data and the flow or transport model, without taking advantage of spatial continuity or other ''prior information.'' The solution is obtained by minimizing the upper bound to the error, or, in a stochastic conceptual framework, as the most likely solution given the data. This solution, although generally not the most accurate since it neglects to utilize structural information that may be available, is of fundamental importance and may be useful as a benchmark. For example, by comparing this solution with other solutions, one can become aware of how prior information or the model of spatial structure affects the solution to the inverse problem.},

This work presents a practical methodology for the estimation of solute concentration contour maps and volume averages (needed for mass calculations) from data obtained from the analysis of water and soil samples. The methodology, which is an extension of linear geostatistics, produces a point estimate, i.e., a representative value, as well as a confidence interval, which contains the true value with a given probability. The approach uses a parsimonious model that accounts for the skewness by adding only one parameter to those used in linear geostatistics (variograms or generalized covariances). The resulting nonlinear kriging method is not substantially more difficult to use than linear geostatistics. The methodology is most appropriate when concentration measurements are available on a reasonably dense grid and no additional information (based on modeling dow and transport) can be used. We present and illustrate through an application, a practical approach to estimate all the parameters needed and to select and test the model. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd},

   volume = {43},
   number = {7},
   pages = {W07417},
   abstract = {Although depletion of storage in low-permeability confining layers is the source of much of the groundwater produced from many confined aquifer systems, it is all too frequently overlooked or ignored. This makes effective management of groundwater resources difficult by masking how much water has been derived from storage and, in some cases, the total amount of water that has been extracted from an aquifer system. Analyzing confining layer storage is viewed as troublesome because of the additional computational burden and because the hydraulic properties of confining layers are poorly known. In this paper we propose a simplified method for computing estimates of confining layer depletion, as well as procedures for approximating confining layer hydraulic conductivity (K) and specific storage (S technique useful in developing countries and other settings where minimal data are available or when scoping calculations are needed. As such, our approach may be helpful for estimating the global transfer of groundwater to surface water. A test of the method on a synthetic system suggests that the computational errors will generally be small. Larger errors will probably result from inaccuracy in confining layer property estimates, but these may be no greater than errors in more sophisticated analyses. The technique is demonstrated by application to two aquifer systems: the Dakota artesian aquifer system in South Dakota and the coastal plain aquifer system in Virginia. In both cases, depletion from confining layers was substantially larger than depletion from the aquifers.},

First, we can analytically compute the sensitivity of the production response with respect to relative permeability parameters. The approach is extremely fast and requires a single streamline simulation run. Second, we can exploit the analogy between streamlines and seismic ray tracing to develop a formalism for efficient inversion of production data. For relative permeability representations we have used the commonly used power functions and also a more flexible representation through the use of B-splines. The relative advantages of these representations are examined through inversions of water-cut data from a nine-spot pattern. Finally, we address the underlying challenges associated with the simultaneous estimation of absolute and relative permeabilities from production data. We systematically investigate the nonuniqueness associated with the inverse problem and quantitatively evaluate the role of additional data such as pressure response in addition to water-cut history at the wells.},

This allows us to define drainage areas or volumes associated with primary recovery and compressible flow under the most general conditions, We then employ developments in seismic tomography and waveform imaging to formulate an efficient approach for integrating transient pressure data into high-resolution reservoir models. The proposed approach exploits an analogy between a propagating wave and a propagating "pressure front" via high-frequency asymptotic solutions to the transient pressure equation. A key advantage of the asymptotic approach is that parameter sensitivities required for solving inverse problems related to production data integration can be obtained analytically using a single streamline simulation. Thus, the approach can be orders of magnitude faster than current techniques that require multiple flow simulations. We demonstrate the power and utility of the approach by applications to both synthetic and field examples. In the field example, the predominant fracture patterns emerging from the inversion are shown to be consistent with outcrop mapping and crosswell seismic imaging.},

In both experiments NaCl was used as a tracer and the extraction rate was twice the injection rate. In the second experiment injection and extraction were interchanged ("reverse experiment"). The withdrawal rate remained twice the injection rate. Long tailing was characteristic for the breakthrough curves in both experiments. The tests were interpreted using a single fracture flow model. Tracer transport is described by advection/dispersion along the fracture allowing for diffusion into an immobile matrix. We were able to interpret the breakthrough curves for both experiments by one unique set of parameters, describing transport and baseflow. Uniqueness could only be achieved when using the information from both experiments. We conclude that performing a reverse experiment is an indispensable tool for parameter identification in dipole tracer tests. A sensitivity analysis proved that not only the exchange of tracer between the mobile zone and the immobile matrix but also transversal dispersivity is responsible for the tailing in the breakthrough curves. Further, the typical exchange time between mobile and immobile media was too small to be attributed to mere molecular diffusion into the matrix. The interpretation of the estimated parameters allows us to conclude that we did not observe matrix diffusion but a fast exchange of tracer between the mobile zone and both the adjacent rock and less pervious zones within the fracture. Analysis of the joint covariance matrices showed that the estimated transport parameters have small errors.},

   abstract = {[1] Decision making in water resources management usually requires the quantification of uncertainties. Monte Carlo techniques are suited for this analysis but imply a huge computational effort. An alternative and computationally efficient approach is the first-order second-moment (FOSM) method which directly propagates parameter uncertainty into the result. We apply the FOSM method to both the groundwater flow and solute transport equations. It is shown how conditioning on the basis of measured heads and/or concentrations yields the "principle of interdependent uncertainty" that correlates the uncertainties of feasible hydraulic conductivities and recharge rates. The method is used to compute the uncertainty of steady state heads and of steady state solute concentrations. It is illustrated by an application to the Palla Road Aquifer in semiarid Botswana, for which the quantification of the uncertainty range of groundwater recharge is of prime interest. The uncertainty bounds obtained by the FOSM method correspond well with the results obtained by the Monte Carlo method. The FOSM method, however, is much more advantageous with respect to computational efficiency. It is shown that at the planned abstraction rate the probability of exceeding the natural replenishment of the Palla Road Aquifer by overpumping is 30%.},

   abstract = {Karstic basins contain large reserves of subsurface water. In this paper, three karstic systems located in the Pyrenees Mountains (Ariege, France) are studied. Long records of rainfall and discharge rates for these karstic springs are available, sampled at different rates: daily, hourly and half-hourly. This study aims at illustrating and assessing the capabilities and limitations of linear black-box methods for analyzing rainfall-runoff type relationships and reconstructing runoffs from rainfall rate data using such systems. In this study, precipitation and discharge rates are considered as two autocorrelated and cross-correlated stochastic processes. A linear and stationary rainfall-runoff model is adopted, which is used for identification and simulation purposes. Different versions are analyzed, including a model based on a convolution integral between the precipitation rate P({tau}) and a transfer function h(t-{tau}) which can be thought of as the unit impulse response of the system. It is shown that this linear stochastic model (i.e. the statistical version), although accurate in some respects, does not represent the hydraulic behaviour of the system very well during low flow episodes and floods. It is also shown that the use of Fourier analysis, alone, does not lead to a satisfactory reconstitution of observed runoff sequences. For these reasons, the use of non-linear random process input-output models based on Volterra integral series is proposed and discussed. (59 Refs.)},

Applicability, adequacy and robustness of the developed numerical model is tested by estimating the transmissivity parameter in various zones of a synthetic confined aquifer. The numerical model is applied to estimate hydraulic conductivity and recharge parameters of various zones in the Mahi Right Bank Canal (MRBC) project area. The solutions of synthetic and field aquifer problems are compared with another inverse model using the Gauss-Newton-Marquardt (GNM) method. Largely, the GA results are better compared to GNM parameter estimates, except, when no measurement errors in the observation head values are assumed. Head distribution computed using the estimated parameters for the MRBC aquifer is found closer to observed head distribution in the aquifer domain. From the adequacy of the estimated parameters the study concludes that the genetic algorithm approach can be successfully used for inverse modeling of regional aquifers where reliable parameter estimation is an important but difficult task for real system simulation.},

   abstract = {Global energy demand of 424 EJ year(-1) in 2000 is increasing at the rate of 2.2% year(-1). There is a strong need to increase biofuel production because of the rising energy costs and the risks of global warming caused by fossil fuel combustion. Biofuels, being C-neutral and renewable energy sources, are an important alternative to fossil fuels. Therefore, identification of viable sources of biofuel feedstock is a high priority. Harvesting lignocellulosic crop residues, especially of cereal crops, is being considered by industry as one of the sources of biofuel feedstocks. Annual production of lignocellulosic residues of cereals is estimated at 367 million Mg year(-1) (75% of the total) for the U.S., and 2800 million Mg year(-1) (74.6% of the total) for the world. The energy value of the residue is 16 x 10(6), BTU Mg-1. However, harvesting crop residues would have strong adverse impact on soil quality. Returning crop residues to soil as amendments is essential to: (a) recycling plant nutrients (20-60 kg of N, P, K, Ca per Mg of crop residues) amounting to 118 million Mg of N, P, K in residues produced annually in the world (83.5% of world's fertilizer consumption), (b) sequestering soil C at the rate of 100-1000 kg C ha(-1) year(-1) depending on soil type and climate with a total potential of 0.6-1.2 Pg C year(-1) in world soils, (c) improving soil structure, water retention and transmission properties, (d) enhancing activity and species diversity of soil fauna, (e) improving water infiltration rate, (f) controlling water runoff and minimizing risks of erosion by water and wind, (g) conserving water in the root zone, and (h) sustaining agronomic productivity by decreasing losses and increasing use efficiency of inputs. Thus, harvesting crop residues as biofuel feedstock would jeopardize soil and water resources which are already under great stress. Biofuel feedstock must be produced through biofuel plantations established on specifically identified soils which do not compete with those dedicated to food crop production. Biofuel plantations, comprising of warm season grasses (e.g., switch grass), short rotation woody perennials (e.g., poplar) and herbaceous species (e.g., miscanthus) must be established on agriculturally surplus/marginal soils or degraded/desertified soils. Plantations established on such soils would restore degraded ecosystems, enhance soil/terrestrial C pool, improve water resources and produce biofuel feedstocks. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The methodology presented in this study is similar in concept to one presented by de Marsily et al. (1984) in that an adjoint sensitivity technique is coupled with a kriging algorithm to calibrate a flow model. The notable difference of the methodology presented in this paper is that it directly identifies the regions where modification of the model's kriged transmissivity or boundary pressure values will directly improve the overall fit between measured and model-calculated heads at selected wells. At the locations identified as most sensitive to transmissivity changes, synthetic transmissivity values, referred to as pilot points, are added to the transmissivity data base and used as input for kriging the transmissivity field. An application of the methodology to data originating from approximately 10 years of regional hydrogeologic site characterization efforts that have been conducted in the Culebra dolomite at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in southeastern New Mexico is presented.},

An innovative aspect of this methodology is the generation of an ensemble of conditional simulations of the transmissivity field which preserve the statistical moments and spatial correlation structure of the measured transmissivity field and honors the measured transmissivity values at their locations. Each simulation is then calibrated, using an iterative procedure, to match an exhaustive set of steady state and transient pressure data. A fully automated inverse algorithm using pilot points as parameters of calibration was employed. The application of this new methodology to the Culebra dolomite flow system produced 70 conditional simulations which were consistent with all the measured transmissivity and head data at the site. Based on an analysis of the calibrated transmissivity fields, the spatial variability of the transmissivity fields was increased as a result of the calibration process. This increase is in part due to the addition of a high-transmissivity feature to each of the transmissivity fields which is needed to match both steady state and transient state head data.},

Unlike their geostatistical counterparts, which simultaneously specify distributions across the entire field, MRFs are based on a collection of full conditional distributions that rely on the local neighborhoods of each element. This critical focus on local specification provides several advantages: (a) MRFs are computationally tractable and are ideally suited to simulation-based computation, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, and (b) model extensions to account for nonstationarity, discontinuity, and varying spatial properties at various scales of resolution are easily accessible in the MRF framework. Our proposed method is computationally efficient and well suited to reconstruct fine-scale spatial fields from coarser, multiscale samples (based on seismic and production data) and sparse fine-scale conditioning data (e.g., well data). It is easy to implement, and it can account for the complex, nonlinear interactions between different scales, as well as the precision of the data at various scales, in a consistent fashion. We illustrate our method with a variety of examples that demonstrate the power and versatility of the proposed approach. Finally, a comparison with Sequential Gaussian Simulation with Block Kriging (SGSBK) indicates similar performance with less restrictive assumptions.},

   pages = {1-13},
   abstract = {[1] Pumping tests belong to the most common techniques of hydrogeological site assessment. While the steady state drawdown is determined by the distribution of transmissivity alone, the transient behavior is also influenced by the storativity field. In geostatistical inverse modeling the spatial distributions of both transmissivity and storativity are inferred from the drawdown curves and prior information on the spatial correlation of the parameter fields. So far, however, transient data have hardly been analyzed by geostatistical inverse methods because the computational effort is rather high. In the present study, we characterize the drawdown by its temporal moments. We present moment-generating equations and corresponding equations to compute the sensitivity of the temporal moments of drawdown with respect to the distributions of transmissivity and storativity. We utilize these equations to infer the transmissivity and storativity fields from transient pumping tests using the quasi-linear geostatistical approach of inverse modeling. Considering temporal moments rather than full drawdown curves drastically reduces the computational effort of the estimation procedure. In test cases we show that the first two temporal moments are sufficient to characterize the drawdown curves. We investigate how erroneous assumptions regarding the spatial variability of storativity affect the estimate of the transmissivity field, and we analyze the effect of truncating the measured drawdown curves.

   abstract = {We present a method for inverting surface magnetic data to recover 3-D susceptibility models. To allow the maximum flexibility for the model to represent geologically realistic structures, we discretize the 3-D model region into a set of rectangular cells, each having a constant susceptibility. The number of cells is generally far greater than the number of the data available, and thus we solve an underdetermined problem. Solutions are obtained by minimizing a global objective function composed of the model objective function and data misfit. The algorithm can incorporate a priori information into the model objective function by using one or more appropriate weighting functions. The model for inversion can be either susceptibility or its logarithm. If susceptibility is chosen, a positivity constraint is imposed to reduce the nonuniqueness and to maintain physical realizability. Our algorithm assumes that there is no remanent magnetization and that the magnetic data are produced by induced magnetization only. All minimizations are carried out with a subspace approach where only a small number of search vectors is used at each iteration. This obviates the need to solve a large system of equations directly, and hence earth models with many cells can be solved on a deskside workstation. The algorithm is tested on synthetic tramples and on a field data set.},

   abstract = {We present an algorithm for inverting induced polarization (IP) data acquired in a 3-D environment. The algorithm is based upon the linearized equation for the IP response, and the inverse problem is solved by minimizing an objective function of the chargeability model subject to data and bound constraints. The minimization is carried out using an interior-point method in which the bounds are incorporated by using a logarithmic barrier and the solution of the linear equations is accelerated using wavelet transforms. Inversion of TP data requires knowledge of the background conductivity. We study the effect of different approximations to the background conductivity by comparing IP inversions performed using different conductivity models, including a uniform half-space and conductivities recovered from one-pass 3-D inversions, composite 2-D inversions, limited AIM updates, and full 3-D nonlinear inversions of the de resistivity data. We demonstrate that, when the background conductivity is simple, reasonable IP results are obtainable without using the best conductivity estimate derived from full 3-D inversion of the de resistivity data. As a final area of investigation, we study the joint use of surface and borehole data to improve the resolution of the recovered chargeability models, We demonstrate that the joint inversion of surface and crosshole data produces chargeability models superior to those obtained from inversions of individual data sets.},

   abstract = {The inversion of magnetic data is inherently nonunique with respect to the distance between the source and observation locations. This manifests itself as an ambiguity in the source depth when surface data are inverted and as an ambiguity in the distance between the source and boreholes if borehole data are inverted. Joint inversion of surface and borehole data can help to reduce this nonuniqueness. To achieve this, we develop an algorithm for inverting data sets that have arbitrary observation locations in boreholes and above the surface. The algorithm depends upon weighting functions that counteract the geometric decay of magnetic kernels with distance from the observer. We apply these weighting functions to the inversion of three-component magnetic data collected in boreholes and then to the joint inversion of surface and borehole data. Both synthetic and field data sets are used to illustrate the new inversion algorithm. When borehole data are inverted directly, three-component data are far more useful in constructing good susceptibility models than are single-component data. However, either can be used effectively in a joint inversion with surface data to produce models that are superior to those obtained by inversion of surface data alone.},

A rotation matrix is applied to the horizontal and vertical derivatives of the model so that the derivative in an arbitrary direction is obtained. A model objective function that measures the flatness with respect to the rotated derivatives favors models that have elongated features with the specified strike and dip angle. Formulations for both 2-D and 3-D cases are presented, and they are illustrated using examples from de resistivity and induced polarization (IP) problems. Synthetic and held examples show that an inversion carried bur using known dip information produces a model that has higher resolution and provides a better representation of the true structure.},

   abstract = {We have developed a methodology for inverting tracer test data using zonation information obtained from two-dimensional radar tomograms to improve the (typically overly smooth) hydraulic conductivity fields obtained from conventional inversion of tracer test data. The method simultaneously yields two-dimensional estimates of hydraulic conductivity as well as petrophysical relationships that relate hydraulic conductivity to radar velocity; these relationships can be assumed to be stationary throughout the area of investigation or to vary as a function of zonation. Using a synthetic three-dimensional hydraulic conductivity field, we apply the developed inversion methodology and explore the impact of the strength and stationarity of the petrophysical relationship as well as the impact of errors that are often associated with radar data acquisition (such as unknown borehole deviation). We find that adding radar tomographic data to tracer test data improves hydrogeological site characterization, even in the presence of minor radar data errors. The results are contingent on the assumption that a relationship between radar velocity and hydraulic conductivity exists. Therefore the applicability of the proposed method may be limited to field sites where this condition is partially or fully satisfied.},

Although life cycle assessment provides a means to quantify these potential benefits and environmental impacts, existing methods limit direct comparison within and between different biofuel systems because of inconsistencies in performance metrics, system boundaries, and underlying parameter values. There is a critical need for standardized life-cycle methods, metrics, and tools to evaluate biofuel systems based on performance of feedstock production and biofuel conversion at regional or national scales, as well as for estimating the net GHG mitigation of an individual biofuel production system to accommodate impending GHG-intensity regulations and GHG emissions trading. Predicting the performance of emerging biofuel systems (e.g., switchgrass cellulosic ethanol) poses additional challenges for life cycle assessment due to lack of commercial-scale feedstock production and conversion systems. Continued political support for the biofuel industry will be influenced by public perceptions of the contributions of biofuel systems towards mitigation of GHG emissions and reducing dependence on petroleum for transportation fuels. Standardization of key performance metrics such as GHG emissions mitigation and net energy yield are essential to help inform both public perceptions and public policy.},

Life cycle assessment can evaluate the impact of these changes on environmental performance metrics. To this end, we analyzed the life cycles of corn-ethanol systems accounting for the majority of U.S. capacity to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy efficiencies on the basis of updated values for crop management and yields, biorefinery operation, and coproduct utilization. Direct-effect GHG emissions were estimated to be equivalent to a 48% to 59% reduction compared to gasoline, a twofold to threefold greater reduction than reported in previous studies. Ethanol-to-petroleum output/input ratios ranged from 10:1 to 13:1 but could be increased to 19:1 if farmers adopted high-yield progressive crop and soil management practices. An advanced closed-loop biorefinery with anaerobic digestion reduced GHG emissions by 67% and increased the net energy ratio to 2.2, from 1.5 to 1.8 for the most common systems. Such improved technologies have the potential to move corn-ethanol closer to the hypothetical performance of cellulosic biofuels. Likewise, the larger GHG reductions estimated in this study allow a greater buffer for inclusion of indirect-effect land-use change emissions while still meeting regulatory GHG reduction targets. These results suggest that corn-ethanol systems have substantially greater potential to mitigate GHG emissions and reduce dependence on imported petroleum for transportation fuels than reported previously.},

The parameter estimation is extended to a complete inverse problem that makes the calibrated groundwater flow model more realistic. The adjoint state method, the gradient search method, and the least square error algorithm are combined to build the optimization procedure. Horizontal two-dimensional groundwater flow in a confined aquifer is exemplified to demonstrate the correlation between unknowns, the contribution of observation, as well as the suitability of applying the inverse method. The correlation analysis shows the connection between storage coefficient and initial condition. Besides, transmissivity and boundary conditions are also highly correlated. More observations at different location and time are necessary to provide sufficient information. A time series of unsteady head is requested for estimation of storage coefficient and initial condition. Observation near boundary is very effective for boundary condition estimation. The observation at pumping well mostly contributes to the estimation of transmissivity. According to all observations, it is possible to identify parameters, initial condition, and boundary condition simultaneously. Furthermore, the results not only illustrate the traditional assumption of known boundary condition but also initial condition, which may cause an incorrect estimation.

   abstract = {Hydraulic tomography (i.e., a sequential aquifer test) has recently been proposed as a method for characterizing aquifer heterogeneity. During a hydraulic tomography experiment, water is sequentially pumped from or injected into an aquifer at different vertical portions or intervals of the aquifer, steady state hydraulic head responses of the aquifer at other intervals are monitored accordingly, yielding many head/discharge (recharge) data sets. With a proper inverse methodology, these data sets can be used to produce an image of heterogeneity in the aquifer. A sequential inverse approach was developed to interpret results of a hydraulic tomography experiment (Yeh and Liu, 2000). For each set of hydraulic tomography data, an iterative geostatistical inverse approach was employed to determine the effective hydraulic conductivity of aquifers, conditioned on the head measurements. To avoid numerical difficulties associated with simultaneous inclusion of all the head data sets, a sequential conditioning approach was developed. This approach used the estimated hydraulic conductivity field and covariances, conditioned on previous sets of head measurements, as prior information for future estimations based on a new set of pumping data. In this study, two sandbox experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the sequential inverse approach for hydraulic tomography. One sandbox was packed with layered sands to represent a stratified aquifer while the other with discontinuous sand bodies of different shapes and sizes to represent a more complex and realistic heterogeneous aquifer. Parallel to the sandbox experiments, numerical experiments were also conducted to evaluate effects of measurement errors and uncertainties associated with laboratory data, and to diagnose the hydraulic conductivity estimates obtained from sandbox experiments. Results of this study show that our sequential inverse approach works well under realistic conditions, in spite of measurement errors and uncertainties associated with pumping rates, boundary conditions, pressure head measurements, and other parameters required by our model. Also presented is the condition under which hydraulic tomography can be effective.},

   abstract = {Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), during the past few years, has emerged as a potentially cost-effective, noninvasive tool for imaging changes of moisture content in the vadose zone. The accuracy of ERT surveys, however, has been the subject of debate because of its nonunique inverse solution and spatial variability in the constitutive relation between resistivity and moisture content. In this paper, an integrative inverse approach for ERT, based on a stochastic information fusion concept of Yeh and Simunek, was developed to derive the best unbiased estimate of the moisture content distribution. Unlike classical ERT inversion approaches, this new approach assimilates prior information about the geological and moisture content structures in a given geological medium, as well as sparse point measurements of the moisture content, electrical resistivity, and electric potential. Using these types of data and considering the spatial variability of the resistivity - moisture content relation, the new approach directly estimates dimensional moisture content distributions instead of simply changes in moisture content in the vadose zone. Numerical experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of uncertainties in the prior information on the estimate. The effects of spatial variability in the constitutive relation were then examined on the interpretation of the change in moisture content, based on the change in electrical resistivity from the ERT survey. Finally, the ability of the integrative approach was tested by directly estimating moisture distributions in three-dimensional, heterogeneous vadose zones. Results show that the integrative approach can produce accurate estimates of the moisture content distributions and that incorporating some measurements of the moisture content is essential to improve the estimate.},

   abstract = {Hydraulic tomography is a method that images the hydraulic heterogeneity of the subsurface through the inversion of multiple pumping or cross-hole hydraulic test data. Transient hydraulic tomography is different from steady state hydraulic tomography in that it utilizes transient hydraulic head records to yield the distribution of hydraulic conductivity (K) as well as specific storage (S-s) of an aquifer. In this paper we demonstrate the robustness of transient hydraulic tomography through the use of hydraulic head data obtained from multiple cross-hole pumping tests conducted in a laboratory sandbox with deterministic heterogeneity. We utilize the algorithm developed by Zhu and Yeh (2005) to conduct the transient inversions and validate the K and S-s tomograms using a multimethod and multiscale validation approach previously proposed by Illman et al. (2006). Validation data consist of cross-hole tests not used in the inversion as well as other hydraulic tests that provided local (core, single-hole tests) as well as large-scale (unidirectional flow-through tests) estimates of hydraulic parameters. Results show that the algorithm is able to yield consistent estimates that agree with independently collected local as well as large-scale hydraulic parameter data. In addition, we find that the transient hydraulic tomography requires a fewer number of pumping tests to estimate a similar quality K tomogram when compared with steady state hydraulic tomography, as the former approach utilizes more data from each pumping test. Overall, we find that transient hydraulic tomography is a robust subsurface characterization technique that can delineate the subsurface heterogeneity in both K and S-s from multiple pumping or cross-hole hydraulic tests.},

   abstract = {The total travel distance and the hydraulic conductivity in steady-state groundwater flow systems are modeled with asymmetric gamma distribution functions. The ratio of the total travel distance over the hydraulic conductivity, scaled by a factor involving the hydraulic gradient and the aquifer porosity, equals the residence time of groundwater. The residence time measures the period elapsed between recharge and discharge of groundwater from an aquifer flow system. The residence time is a random variable whose probability density function (p.d.f.) is determined by those of the total travel distance and the hydraulic conductivity. The p.d.f. of the residence time was derived and from that, applying basic mass-balance considerations, followed that of the groundwater age. The age is the time elapsed since the recharge of groundwater in transit through an aquifer flow system. It is shown that the p.d.f.s of the residence time and the groundwater age are related by a first-order, linear, differential equation. The cumulative distribution functions of the residence time and the groundwater age and their first and second moments are also derived, and so is the output concentration of a solute that enters a steady-state groundwater flow system dissolved in recharge. A computational example illustrates the advantage of treating the residence time and the groundwater age statistically and constraining them with Darcy's law and mass-balance principles. Solute output shows a complex structure with stable and radioactive solutes in deceptively simple steady-state groundwater flow regimes. CP 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. (18 Refs.)},

In addition, we proceed from these new equations to a linear approximation to the cokriging results in the event that the crossvariograms are small, allowing one to take advantage of a recent results of Xie and others which proceeds by diagonalizing the variogram matrix function over the lag classes.},

A volume of fractured rock can be said to behave like a representative volume of an equivalent porous medium when (1) there is an insignificant change in the value of the equivalent permeability with a small addition or subtraction to the test volume and (2) an equivalent permeability tensor exists which predicts the correct flux when the direction of a constant gradient is changed. A two-dimensional fracture system model is developed. Simulated flow tests through the models measure directional permeability, K (sub g) . A polar coordinate plot of 1/ K (sub g) will be an ellipse if the medium behaves like a equivalent anisotropic, homogeneous porous medium. Whatever shape the plot is, a best fit ellipse can be calculated and the scatter of measurements around the ellipse is expressed as NMSE, the normalized mean square error. NMSE approaches zero as the behavior approaches that of a continuum. In another study the modeling techniques were applied to data from the Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd.'s.

Well test data were used to estimate the aperture distribution for the model.--Modified author abstract.},

Thus where the disk model is appropriate it is possible to calculate flow through fracture networks which are statistically similar to those that occur in nature. After the boundary conditions and the desired fractures are specified, the intersections (nodes) between these disks (elements) are identified. Then steady flow through the network is calculated using a mixed analytical-numerical technique. In each fracture, analytic equations for flow into or out of each node as a function of the average head at each node are developed. The equations are based on image theory and the assumption that each node is a source (or sink) of uniform strength. A set of mass balance equations is constructed which equate flow into a node from one of its associated fractures to flow out of the node into the other associated fracture. These equations are solved for the average head at each node, and flux between fractures can then be calculated by substituting the average head values back into the analytical equations. The model has been successfully checked against analytical results for several cases of two and three intersecting fractures.--Modified journal abstract.},

At each subsurface grid point, the inversion result consists of the most likely lithotype (gas, sand, shale, etc.) together with its related litho parameters (frame strength, porosity, etc.). The inversion method is based on the Bayesian theory of parameter estimation, allowing specification of inaccuracies in the input and the incorporation of geological knowledge. An important advantage of the proposed inversion method is that for each practical situation the necessary accuracy of c(p), c(s) and rho can be predetermined to distinguish between specific lithotypes or to estimate a specific litho parameter with a prespecified accuracy. For instance, inversion results show that water saturation can only be estimated for an unrealistic accurate input. On the other hand, for the estimation of porosities it is generally sufficient to have compressional velocities available with a realistic accuracy.},

   abstract = {[1] Discrete zones of groundwater discharge in a stream within a peat-dominated wetland were identified on the basis of variations in streambed temperature using a distributed temperature sensor (DTS). The DTS gives measurements of the spatial (+/- 1 m) and temporal (15 min) variation of streambed temperature over a much larger reach of stream (> 800 m) than previous methods. Isolated temperature anomalies observed along the stream correspond to focused groundwater discharge zones likely caused by soil pipes within the peat. The DTS also recorded variations in the number of temperature anomalies, where higher numbers correlated well with a gaining reach identified by stream gauging. Focused zones of groundwater discharge showed essentially no change in position over successive measurement periods. Results suggest DTS measurements will complement other techniques ( e. g., seepage meters and stream gauging) and help further improve our understanding of groundwater-surface water dynamics in wetland streams.},

   abstract = {A field test on in situ subsurface bioremediation of uranium(VI) is underway at the Y-12 National Security Complex in the Oak Ridge Reservation, Oak Ridge, TN. Nitrate has a high concentration at the site, which prevents U(VI) reduction, and thus must be removed. An acidic-flush strategy for nitrate removal was proposed to create a treatment zone with low levels of accessible nitrate. The subsurface at the site contains highly interconnected fractures surrounded by matrix blocks of low permeability and high porosity and is therefore subjectto preferential flow and matrix diffusion. To identify the heterogeneous mass transfer properties, we performed a novel forced-gradient tracer test, which involved the addition of bromide, the displacement of nitrate, and the rebound of nitrate after completion of pumping. The simplest conceptualization consistent with the data is that the pore-space consists of a single mobile domain, as well as a fast and a slowly reacting immobile domain. The slowly reacting immobile domain (shale matrix) constitutes over 80% of the pore volume and acts as a long-term reservoir of nitrate. According to simulations, the nitrate stored in the slowly interacting immobile domain in the fast flow layer, at depths of about 12.2-13.7 m, will be reduced by an order of magnitude over a period of about a year. By contrast, the mobile domain rapidly responds to flushing, and a low average nitrate concentration can be maintained if the nitrate is removed as soon as it enters the mobile domain. A field-scale experiment in which the aquifer was flushed with acidic solution confirmed our understanding of the system. For the ongoing experiments on microbial U(VI) reduction, nitrate concentrations must be low in the mobile domain to ensure U(VI) reducing conditions. We therefore conclude that the nitrate leaching out of the immobile pore space must continuously be removed by in situ denitrification to maintain favorable conditions.

The flow fields include: a well doublet in the absence of regional flow; an 'encaged recirculation cell' where a well doublet is located within and parallel to a uniform regional flow; and a well doublet with arbitrarily oriented uniform regional flow. For a well doublet in the absence of regional flow, we present an analytical solution for all streamlines. For the encaged recirculation cell, the first breakthrough time is solved analytically. We also develop a semi-analytical scheme to evaluate the residence time for any ratio of recirculated flow in a well doublet with arbitrarily oriented uniform regional flow. Both streamlines and travel times in the recirculation zone are strictly symmetric with respect to the midpoint between the two wells. We determine the starting points of streamlines at the well screen for a specific cumulative discharge by an analytical method. Using these starting points in a particle-tracking scheme, one is led directly to the cumulative breakthrough curve at the extraction well. Furthermore, we provide a convenient semi-analytical solution for the average residence time in the recirculation zone. The presented schemes minimize the number of particles that need to be tracked in the construction of breakthrough curves and help to efficiently design recirculation schemes for remediation purposes and to analyze tracer test data obtained in such systems.

Erratic regional flow conditions may compromise the performance of the reactor between a single well pair. We propose an alternative four-well system: two downgradient extraction and two upgradient injection wells creating an inner cell nested within an outer cell. The outer cell protects the inner cell from the influence of regional flow. Compared to a two-well system, the proposed four-well system has several advantages: (1) the recirculation ratio within the nested inner cell is less sensitive to the regional flow direction; (2) a transitional recirculation zone between the inner and outer cells can capture flow leakage from the inner cell, minimizing the release of untreated contaminants; and (3) the size of the recirculation zone and residence times can be better controlled within the inner cell by changing the pumping rates. The system is applied at the Field Research Center in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where experiments on microbial in situ reduction of uranium (VI) are under way.

Aquifer cleanup time is a highly nonlinear and nonconvex function of pumping rates. The cleanup objective often involves minimizing or constraining the cleanup time or cleanup cost. Linear programming and nonlinear optimization cannot guarantee the global solution. In this study, four global optimization (GO) algorithms, including a popular genetic algorithm, are used to minimize both cleanup time and cleanup cost taking pumping rates and/or well locations as decision variables. Groundwater flow and particle-tracking models (MODFLOW and MODPATH) and a GO tool (GLOBE) are used. Real and hypothetical contaminated aquifers are considered for application. The results are satisfactory and show that GO techniques can be widely applied in groundwater remediation strategy and planning. The comparison of the performance of algorithms did not reveal a clear winner. The results also show that in the particle-tracking method, excluding few particles from removal can significantly reduce the cleanup time.},

   abstract = {Two case studies are presented as examples of a decision-analysis approach to engineering design for projects in which the hydrogeological environment plays an important role. This approach to design involves quantifying benefits, costs, and risks for each design alternative under consideration. Risk, which is defined as the expected costs of failure, reflects both performance uncertainties and failure costs. Probabilities of failure are estimated by coupling stochastic ground-water flow and solute transport models with uncertainty models that represent input parameters as random variables. The case studies that are used to describe the approach involve (1) selecting a pumping rate for an extraction well to capture an existing contaminant plume, and (2) designing a leachate collection system for a soil remediation facility. The examples illustrate that the decision-analysis approach can be accomplished using relatively simple analytical models to simulate the behaviors of hydrogeological environments and engineering components. The results identify how the preferred design alternative depends upon the regulatory, hydrogeological, and economic environments in which the decision is made. For the extraction well example, the preferred alternative is relatively insensitive to the costs of failure but is dependent upon the expected dimensions of the contaminant plume. For the soil remediation example, the preferred design alternative depends upon the anticipated costs of failure and the regulatory standard for ground-water contamination. Reducing the variance or uncertainty in dispersivity values by a factor of 3 had a relatively small effect on the overall design of the leachate collection system.},

One well pumped contaminated groundwater from the 8 m thick upper aquifer to the 5 m thick lower aquifer, while the other pumped contaminated water from the lower to the upper aquifers using flow rates of 25-38 L/min, effecting groundwater circulation between them. Following 18 days of periodic toluene injection to develop an active biological population, continuous pulses of toluene were added. Over 312 days, an average 87+-8% TCE removal was obtained in the upper aquifer with each pass through the treatment well. In the lower aquifer, removals were 83+-16% over the last 79 days when peroxide addition was reduced. Treatment reduced TCE in the regional groundwater plumes from about 1000 {mu}g/L in new water entering the 480 m{sup 2} monitored treatment zone to an average of 18-24 {mu}g/L in groundwater leaving the treatment zone, indicating total TCE removal of 97-98%.

   abstract = {Recent field and laboratory investigations show that fracture and matrix pore structure in mudrock saprolite at the Oak Ridge Reservation in east Tennessee is far more complex than typically assumed, and that this complexity strongly influences flow and contaminant transport. Flow and transport models based on continuum or dual-continuum approaches or on approaches using discrete fractures in a uniform fine-grained matrix have been used with some success in describing solute transport in these materials. However, these approaches are likely to be less effective in dealing with transport of colloids or DNAPLs, both of which are strongly influenced by pore structure heterogeneity. For example, DNAPL/water capillary pressure-saturation curves measured in a sample of the saprolite showed only an indistinct break between fracture drainage and matrix drainage. This was consistent with microscopic inspection of thin-sections of the saprolite, which showed that many of the prominent fractures were in-filled with translocated pedogenic clays, and that there were more frequent root holes and microfractures, and a greater variability in matrix pore diameter than initially expected. These translocated clays are also believed responsible for the existence of a low permeability layer at about 1.5 m depth, which leads to frequent perched water table conditions and rapid downslope migration. Studies of colloid transport in undisturbed columns of saprolite indicate that although most of the colloids (and hence most of the flow) pass through tortuous channels in the prominent fractures, some of the smaller colloids also penetrate the microfractures and the fine-grained matrix. These pores likely play a significant role in colloid retention because of the greater probability of colloids attaching to soil surfaces in the slow-moving water within the smaller pores. Finally, the investigations show that fracture and matrix pore size vary greatly in saprolite formed from different lithologies comprising the parent material, even though the overall appearance of the saprolite is fairly uniform and physical parameters such as total porosity and bulk hydraulic conductivity do not show unusually large variations. These ongoing studies demonstrate that fine-scale characterization of lithology and fracture/matrix properties using conventional geologic and pedologic techniques can aid in understanding flow and transport processes in mudrock saprolite.},

   abstract = {Recent work with stochastic inverse modeling techniques has led to the development of efficient algorithms for the construction of transmissivity (T) fields conditioned to measurements of T and head. Small numbers of calibration targets and correlation between model parameters in these inverse solutions can lead to a relatively large region in parameter space that will produce a near optimal calibration of the T field to measured heads. Most applications of these inverse techniques have not considered the effects of non-unique calibration on subsequent predictions made with the T fields. Use of these T fields in predictive contaminant transport modeling must take into account the non-uniqueness of the T field calibration. A recently developed 'predictive estimation' technique is presented and employed to create T fields that are conditioned to observed heads and measured T values while maximizing the conservatism of the associated predicted advective travel time. Predictive estimation employs confidence and prediction intervals calculated simultaneously on the flow and transport models, respectively. In an example problem, the distribution of advective transport results created with the predictive estimation technique is compared to the distribution of results created under traditional T field optimization where model non-uniqueness is not considered. The predictive estimation technique produces results with significantly shorter travel times relative to traditional techniques while maintaining near optimal calibration. Additionally, predictive estimation produces more accurate estimates of the fastest travel times. CP 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. (19 Refs.)},

A dual continuum model (DCM) for simulating transient flow and transport at Yucca Mountain is developed. In order to ensure properly converged flow solutions, which are used in the transport simulation, a new flow solution convergence criteria is derived. An extensive series of simulation studies is presented which indicates that rapid movement of solute through the fractures will not occur unless there are intense episodic infiltration events. Movement of solute in the environs of the repository is enhanced if the properties of the tuff layer at the repository horizon are modified from current best-estimate values. Due to a large advective-dispersive coupling between the matrix and fractures, the matrix acts as a major buffer which inhibits rapid transport along the fractures. Consequently, fast movement of solutes through the fractures to the repository depth can only be explained if the matrix-fracture coupling term is significantly reduced from a value that would be calculated on the basis of data currently available.},

In this paper, we address two of them: first, the computational cost of sensitivity (Jacobian) matrices and, second, the evaluation of the relative weights of different types of data. Regarding the first, we revise the adjoint state equations to propose a form whose cost is independent of the number of unknown parameters and only grows with the number of observation wells. Regarding the second, we derive expressions for the relative weights of different types of data. These expressions are based on minimizing the expected likelihood, rather than the likelihood itself. The efficiency of both improvements is tested on a synthetic example. The example analyzes a wide range of groundwater flow and solute transport conditions. Yet, the expected likelihood consistently yields the optimal weights. The proposed form of the adjoint state equations leads to one order of magnitude reduction in CPU time with respect to the conventional sensitivity equations. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Many ground water modeling efforts use a finite-difference method to solve the ground water flow equation, and many of these models require a relatively fine-grid discretization to accurately represent the selected process in limited areas of interest. Use of a fine grid over the entire domain can be computationally prohibitive; using a variably spaced grid can lead to cells with a large aspect ratio and refinement in areas where detail is not needed. One solution is to use local-grid refinement (LGR) whereby the grid is only refined in the area of interest. This work reviews some LGR methods and identifies advantages and drawbacks in test cases using MODFLOW-2000. The first test case is two dimensional and heterogeneous; the second is three dimensional and includes interaction with a meandering river. Results include simulations using a uniform fine grid, a variably spaced grid, a traditional method of LGR without feedback, and a new shared node method with feedback. Discrepancies from the solution obtained with the uniform fine grid are investigated. For the models tested, the traditional one-way coupled approaches produced discrepancies in head up to 6.8% and discrepancies in cell-to-cell fluxes up to 7.1%, while the new method has head and cell-to-cell flux discrepancies of 0.089% and 0.14%, respectively. Additional results highlight the accuracy, flexibility, and CPU time trade-off of these methods and demonstrate how the new method can be successfully implemented to model surface water-ground water interactions.},

An improved first-order reliability approach is presented wherein the linearization point varies to match the output level whose exceedance probability is sought. Thus, the improved approach circumvents some of the problems of central value linearization while retaining much of its simplicity. The accuracy, relative to Monte Carlo simulation, of the improved approach and its use are demonstrated for an example of estimating the probability distribution of peak discharge predicted by two conceptual rainfall-runoff models with uncertain parameters.},

This allows for the evaluation of the effective velocity and dispersion coefficient for a homogeneous domain without resorting to numerical modeling. The equations for the spatial moments and the phase-transition probabilities are used for the development of a new random-walk particle-tracking method. The method is tested against three alternate formulations and is found to be computationally efficient without sacrificing accuracy. We apply the new random-walk method to investigate the possibility of a double peak in the aqueous solute concentration resulting from kinetic sorption. The occurrence of a double peak is found to be dependent on the value of the Damkohler number, and the timing of its appearance is controlled by the mass transfer rate and the retardation factor. Two ranges of the Damkohler number leading to double peaking are identified. In the first range (Da(1) less than or equal to 1), double peaking occurs for all retardation factors, while in the second range (1 less than or equal to Da(1) less than or equal to 3), this behavior is most significant for R > 12.},

   abstract = {environmental sciences. In many applications, the parameters being estimated or mapped have physical constraints, such as nonnegativity (e.g. concentration, hydraulic conductivity), solubility limits, censored data (e.g. due to dry wells or detection limits), and other physical boundaries or missing data. Geostatistical interpolation and inverse modelling techniques have often been applied for estimating such parameters, but these methods typically cannot enforce physical constraints. This paper describes a statistically rigorous and computationally efficient Gibbs sampler, a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique, based on an a priori truncated Gaussian distribution model, which allows for multiple and variable physical constraints to be enforced within a geostatistical framework. Sample interpolation and inverse modelling applications confirm that estimates, uncertainty bounds and conditional simulations reflect the specified constraints, leading to conclusions that are more consistent with the underlying conceptual model, and provide a more accurate measure of the posterior uncertainty of the parameters being estimated. In addition, especially in inverse modelling applications, a posteriori confidence bounds are narrower even in areas where constraints are not imposed. The method is applicable in multiple dimensions, for data with or without measurement error, and with any variogram model.},

   abstract = {[1] When an inverse problem is solved to estimate an unknown function such as the hydraulic conductivity in an aquifer or the contamination history at a site, one constraint is that the unknown function is known to be everywhere nonnegative. In this work, we develop a statistically rigorous method for enforcing function nonnegativity in Bayesian inverse problems. The proposed method behaves similarly to a Gaussian process with a linear variogram (i.e., unrestricted Brownian motion) for parameter values significantly greater than zero. The method uses the method of images to define a prior probability density function based on reflected Brownian motion that implicitly enforces nonnegativity. This work focuses on problems where the unknown is a function of a single variable (e. g., time). A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, specifically, a highly efficient Gibbs sampler, is implemented to generate conditional realizations of the unknown function. The new method is applied to the estimation of the trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE) contamination history in an aquifer at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, based on concentration profiles obtained from an underlying aquitard.},

   abstract = {As the incidence of groundwater contamination continues to grow, a number of inverse modelling methods have been developed to address forensic groundwater problems. In this work the geostatistical approach to inverse modelling is extended to allow for the recovery of the antecedent distribution of a contaminant at a given point back in time, which is critical to the assessment of historical exposure to contamination. Such problems are typically strongly underdetermined, with a large number of points at which the distribution is to be estimated. To address this challenge, the computational efficiency of the new method is increased through the application of the adjoint state method. In addition, the adjoint problem is presented in a format that allows for the reuse of existing groundwater flow and transport codes as modules in the inverse modelling algorithm. As demonstrated in the presented applications, the geostatistical approach combined with the adjoint state method allow for a historical multidimensional contaminant distribution to be recovered even in heterogeneous media, where a numerical solution is required for the forward problem.},

   pages = {213-239},
   abstract = {Regularization is the most popular technique to overcome the null space of model parameters in geophysical inverse problems, and is implemented by including a constraint term as well as the data-misfit term in the objective function being minimized. The weighting of the constraint term relative to the data-fitting term is controlled by a regularization parameter, and its adjustment to obtain the best model has received much attention. The empirical Bayes approach discussed in this paper determines the optimum value of the regularization parameter from a given data set. The regularization term can be regarded as representing a priori information about the model parameters. The empirical Bayes approach and its more practical variant, Akaike's Bayesian Information Criterion, adjust the regularization parameter automatically in response to the level of data noise and to the suitability of the assumed a priori model information for the given data. When the noise level is high, the regularization parameter is made large, which means that the a priori information is emphasized. If the assumed a priori information is not suitable for the given data, the regularization parameter is made small. Both these behaviours are desirable characteristics for the regularized solutions of practical inverse problems. Four simple examples are presented to illustrate these characteristics for an underdetermined problem, a problem adopting an improper prior constraint and a problem having an unknown data variance, all frequently encountered geophysical inverse problems. Numerical experiments using Akaike's Bayesian Information Criterion for synthetic data provide results consistent with these characteristics. In addition, concerning the selection of an appropriate type of a priori model information, a comparison between four types of difference-operator model - the zeroth-, first-, second- and third-order difference-operator models - suggests that the automatic determination of the optimum regularization parameter becomes more difficult with increasing order of the difference operators. Accordingly, taking the effect of data noise into account, it is better to employ the lower-order difference-operator models for inversions of noisy data.

Flow is one-dimensional, perpendicular to the stream in the confined and leaky aquifers, and two-dimensional in a plane perpendicular to the stream in the water-table aquifers. The stream is assumed to penetrate the full thickness of the aquifer. The aquifers may be semi-infinite or finite in width and may or may not be bounded at the stream by a semipervious streambank. The solutions are presented in a unified manner so that mathematical relations among the various aquifer configurations are clearly demonstrated. The Laplace transform solutions are inverted numerically to obtain the real-time step-response functions for use in the convolution (or superposition) integral. To maintain linearity in the case of unconfined aquifers, fluctuations in the elevation of the water table are assumed to be small relative to the saturated thickness, and vertical flow into or out of the zone above the water table is assumed to occur instantaneously. Effects of hysteresis in the moisture distribution above the water table are therefore neglected. Graphical comparisons of the new solutions are made with known closed-form solutions. (26 Refs.)},

   pages = {1-14},
   abstract = {An equation is derived through which the variance of predictive error of a calibrated model can be calculated. This equation has two terms. The first term represents the contribution to predictive error variance that results from an inability of the calibration process to capture all of the parameterization detail necessary for the making of an accurate prediction. If a model is "uncalibrated," with parameter values being supplied solely through "outside information," this is the only term required. The second term represents the contribution to predictive error variance arising from measurement noise. In an overdetermined system, such as that which may be obtained through "parameter lumping" (e.g., through the introduction of a spatial zonation scheme), this is the only term required. It is shown, however, that parameter lumping is a form of "implicit regularization" and that ignoring the implied first term of the predictive error variance equation can potentially lead to underestimation of predictive error variance. A model's role as a predictor of environmental behavior can be enhanced if it is calibrated in such a way as to reduce the variance of those predictions which it is required to make. It is shown that in some circumstances this can be accomplished through "overfitting" against historical field data. It can also be accomplished by giving greater weight to those measurements which carry the greatest information content with respect to a required prediction. This suggests that a departure may be necessary from the custom of using a single "calibrated model" for the making of many different predictions. Instead, model calibration may need to be repeated many times so that in each case the calibration process is optimized for the making of a specific model prediction.

   abstract = {Calibration of a groundwater model requires that hydraulic properties be estimated throughout a model domain. This generally constitutes an underdetermined inverse problem, for which a solution can only be found when some kind of regularization device is included in the inversion process. Inclusion of regularization in the calibration process can be implicit, for example through the use of zones of constant parameter value, or explicit, for example through solution of a constrained minimization problem in which parameters are made to respect preferred values, or preferred relationships, to the degree necessary for a unique solution to be obtained. The "cost of uniqueness" is this: no matter which regularization methodology is employed, the inevitable consequence of its use is a loss of detail in the calibrated field. This, in turn, can lead to erroneous predictions made by a model that is ostensibly "well calibrated". Information made available as a by-product of the regularized inversion process allows the reasons for this loss of detail to be better understood. In particular, it is easily demonstrated that the estimated value for an hydraulic property at any point within a model domain is, in fact, a weighted average of the true hydraulic property over a much larger area. This averaging process causes loss of resolution in the estimated field. Where hydraulic conductivity is the hydraulic property being estimated, high averaging weights exist in areas that are strategically disposed with respect to measurement wells, while other areas may contribute very little to the estimated hydraulic conductivity at any point within the model domain, this possibly making the detection of hydraulic conductivity anomalies in these latter areas almost impossible. A study of the post-calibration parameter field covariance matrix allows further insights into the loss of system detail incurred through the calibration process to be gained. A comparison of pre- and postcalibration parameter covariance matrices shows that the latter often possess a much smaller spectral bandwidth than the former. It is also demonstrated that, as an inevitable consequence of the fact that a calibrated model cannot replicate every detail of the true system, model-to-measurement residuals can show a high degree of spatial correlation, a fact which must be taken into account when assessing these residuals either qualitatively, or quantitatively in the exploration of model predictive uncertainty. These principles are demonstrated using a synthetic case in which spatial parameter definition is based on pilot points, and calibration is implemented using both zones of piecewise constancy and constrained minimization regularization.

   abstract = {Genetic algorithm (GA) is considered to be a robust technique for solving ground-water optimization problems. Often these problems are difficult to solve using traditional gradient-based techniques as these are nonlinear, nonconvex, and discontinuous. In this manuscript, recent research related to application of GA in solving these problems is critically reviewed, and three areas of potential enhancement to GA are identified and explored. These enhancement methods to GA are fitness reduction method (FRM), search bound sampling method (SBSM), and optimal resource allocation guideline (ORAG). In order to assess these methods, a non-linear ground-water problem with fixed and variable costs is selected (from literature) where the corresponding optimal solution using a gradient-based nonlinear programming (NLP) technique is available. The problem is resolved using GA coupled with the enhancement methods, and the GA solutions are compared with the NLP solution. In addition, the sensitivity of these methods to various GA parameters are studied. The results of the analysis using the enhancement methods show the following: (1) FRM enhances efficiency of GA in handling constraints; (2) SBSM enhances accuracy of GA in solving problems with fixed costs; (3) ORAG enhances reliability of GA by providing some convergence guarantee for a given computational resource; and (4) when applied with FRM and SBSM, accuracy of GA is marginally increased from near-optimal to global-optimal by tuning any one of the several parameters. There appears to be little need to embark on a full-scale analysis for achieving the increase.},

   abstract = {Probabilistic formulation of inverse problems leads to the definition of a probability distribution in the model space. This probability distribution combines a priori information with new information obtained by measuring some observable parameters (data). As, in the general case, the theory linking data with model parameters is nonlinear, the a posteriori probability in the model space may not be easy to describe (it may be multimodal, some moments may not be defined, etc.). When analysing an inverse problem, obtaining a maximum likelihood model is usually not sufficient, as we normally also wish to have information on the resolution power of the data. In the general case we may have a large number of model parameters, and an inspection of the marginal probability densities of interest may be impractical, or even useless. But it is possible to pseudorandomly generate a large collection of models according to the posterior probability distribution and to analyse and display the models in such a way that information on the relative likelihoods of model properties is conveyed to the spectator. This can be accomplished by means of an efficient Monte Carlo method, even in cases where no explicit formula for the a priori distribution is available. The most well known importance sampling method, the Metropolis algorithm, can be generalized, and this gives a method that allows analysis of (possibly highly nonlinear) inverse problems with complex a priori information and data with an arbitrary noise distribution.

   journal = {Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres},

   abstract = {This study presents monthly CO2 fluxes from 1997 to 2001 at a 3.75 degrees latitude x 5 degrees longitude resolution, inferred using a geostatistical inverse modeling approach. The approach focuses on quantifying the information content of measurements from the NOAA-ESRL cooperative air sampling network with regard to the global CO2 budget at different spatial and temporal scales. The geostatistical approach avoids the use of explicit prior flux estimates that have formed the basis of previous synthesis Bayesian inversions and does not prescribe spatial patterns of flux for large, aggregated regions. Instead, the method relies strongly on the atmospheric measurements and the inferred spatial autocorrelation of the fluxes to estimate sources and sinks and their associated uncertainties at the resolution of the atmospheric transport model. Results show that grid-scale estimates exhibit high uncertainty and relatively little small-scale variability, but generally reflect reasonable fluxes in areas that are relatively well constrained by measurements. The aggregated continental-scale fluxes are better constrained, and estimates are consistent with results from previous synthesis Bayesian inversion studies for many regions. Observed differences at the continental scale are primarily attributable to the choice of a priori assumptions in the current work relative to those in other synthesis Bayesian studies. Overall, the results indicate that the geostatistical inverse modeling approach is able to estimate global fluxes using the limited atmospheric measurement network without relying on assumptions about a priori estimates of the flux distribution. As such, the method provides a means of isolating the information content of the atmospheric measurements, and thus serves as a valuable tool for reconciling top-down and bottom-up estimates of CO2 flux variability.},

   abstract = {Boundary-value problems involve two dependent variables: a potential function and a stream function. They can be approached in two mutually independent ways. The first, introduced by Laplace, involves spatial gradients at a point. Inspired by Faraday, Maxwell introduced the other, visualizing the flow domain as a collection of flow tubes and isopotential surfaces. Boundary-value problems intrinsically entail coupled treatment (or, equivalently, optimization) of potential and stream functions. Historically, potential theory avoided the cumbersome optimization task through ingenious techniques such as conformal mapping and Green's functions. Laplace's point-based approach and Maxwell's global approach each provides its own unique insights into boundary-value problems. Commonly, Laplace's equation is solved either algebraically or with approximate numerical methods. Maxwell's geometry-based approach opens up novel possibilities of direct optimization, providing an independent logical basis for numerical models, rather than treating them as approximate solvers of the differential equation. Whereas points, gradients, and Darcy's law are central to posing problems on the basis of Laplace's approach, flow tubes, potential differences, and the mathematical form of Ohm's law are central to posing them in natural coordinates oriented along flow paths. Besides being of philosophical interest, optimization algorithms can provide advantages that complement the power of classical numerical models. In the spirit of Maxwell, who eloquently spoke for a balance between abstract mathematical symbolism and observable attributes of concrete objects, this paper is an examination of the central ideas of the two approaches, and a reflection on how Maxwell's integral visualization may be practically put to use in a world of digital computers.},

   abstract = {In 1979, a new geotechnical test facility was constructed within the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) Experimental Mine, which is located in the fractured crystalline Precambrian rocks of the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains about 60 kilometers west of Denver, Colorado. As part of this geotechnical facility, the CSM-OCRD Room was excavated and more than 870 individual fractures were mapped from eleven parallel mining faces exposed during excavation. From these observations, this study evaluated the three-dimensional (3D) geometry of the fracture network at the CSM-OCRD Room using statistics of spherical data. These statistics were then used to generate 3D stochastic computer models simulating the fracture network geometry at the CSM-OCRD Room. These 3D stochastic models were validated using the fractal box counting method. Subsequently, the hydraulic behavior of the generated 3D network was evaluated using finite element fracture flow modeling techniques. The statistical evaluation of fracture geometry data suggested that the fracture network can be described in terms of a multimodal spherical distribution consisting of four modes. Two of the modes are symmetrical around their mean direction axis and were modeled using the Fisher distribution. The other two modes lack such symmetry and were modeled using the Kent distribution. These spherical models were used by the FraeMan software, developed by Dershowitz and made available to this project by Golder Associates, Inc., to generate computerized 3D stochastic fracture realizations that have the same statistical properties as the field data. The generated 3D stochastic realizations were then validated using the fractal box counting method. The two-dimensional (2D) fracture trace maps corresponding to the eleven mining faces at the CSM-OCRD Room were analyzed to evaluate whether the 2D trace maps possess fractal behavior, and if so, numerically estimate the fractal dimension of these trace maps. Similarly, the fractal behavior of the 2D stochastic trace maps (generated by slicing the 3D stochastic model) were also evaluated. The results of the fractal study indicate that the scales over which the two series of trace maps exhibit fractal behavior are similar. The fractal dimensions of the trace maps corresponding to the eleven mining faces are tightly clustered, even though the fracture networks appear quite different. They generally range between 1.27 and 1.50, and the average fractal dimension is 1.37. The fractal dimensions of the stochastic trace maps average 1.55, slightly higher than the maximum fractal dimension computed for the 2D field trace maps. However, the estimates are believed to be still in reasonable agreement considering the accuracy of the methods used to calculate the fractal dimension. Accordingly, the stochastic generation of 3D fracture networks by FraeMan utilizing the statistical definitions appears validated. The stochastic network representations were found to accurately model the field conditions and fracture network geometry exhibited by the fractured rock masses found in the area of the CSM-OCRD Room. The global 3D permeability properties of the stochastic fracture networks were computed to determine whether the fracture system behaves as an anisotropic homogeneous medium with a symmetric permeability tensor, and to evaluate the effect of the geometric model statistical parameters on that behavior. Finite element flow analysis implemented in the computer program MAFIC, also made available to this project by Golder Associates, Inc., were used to perform these evaluations. Permeability tensors were calculated for the 3D fracture network simulating the geometry of fractures at the CSM-OCRD Room. At small scales, the permeability tensor of the fracture system is not an ellipsoid, but is indeed very irregular, and the fracture system does not behave as an homogeneous anisotropic medium. As the scale of analysis increased, the shape of the permeability tensor approached an ellipsoid. The results indicate that at scales corresponding to 2.5 meters and higher, the permeability tensor plotted as an ellipsoid. Therefore, at a scale equal to or larger than 2.5 meters, the fracture network behaves as a homogeneous anisotropic medium with a symmetric permeability tensor, and may be modeled as an equivalent porous medium. A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of the concentration parameter k, which describes the dispersion of the fracture orientations around their mean axis. This analysis indicated that the shape of the permeability tensor is sensitive to the values of k, when these values are small, and therefore, higher confidence in the values of k needs to obtained in those cases. Less precision is needed for higher values of k. Similarly, the effect of the ovalness parameter beta , which measures the degree of asymmetry of fracture orientations around the mean axis, was evaluated. It was found that the shape of the permeability tensor is sensitive to the ovalness parameter at higher values of beta , where the fracture distributions are highly oval. Therefore, higher confidence in the value of beta is required when such distributions are being modeled. The effect of fracture intensity on the hydraulic behavior of the fracture system was also evaluated. It was found that as the fracture intensity increases, the shape of the permeability tensor approached an ellipsoid, and the fracture network increasingly behaved as an equivalent porous medium.},

The flow must be assumed to take place in individual channels within existing fracture planes or fracture zones. This has implications on the observability of the flow conduits and has consequences for the migration velocity and dispersion of the radionuclides. Available observations and their impact on radionuclide migration are discussed. In both studies it was concluded that the by far most important retardation mechanism for the nuclides is matrix diffusion. It has so large impact that the validation of this process over long times and over the distances involved special efforts. Past and present efforts to study this process are described. The importance of the natural redox buffer system of the rock to contain disturbances by intrusion of oxygen or due to radiolysis as well as the overall importance of a reducing environment to ensure low actinide solubilities and high sorption capacity of the rock is described. The in situ availability of the reducing minerals is still largely an open question.--Modified report abstract.},

   abstract = {This paper summarizes lessons learned from single-hole and cross-hole pneumatic injection tests recently completed by The University of Arizona in unsaturated fractured tuffs at the Apache Leap Research Site near Superior, Arizona. The research was designed to investigate, test, and confirm methods and conceptual-mathematical models that can be used to determine the role of fractures and fracture zones in flow and transport through partially saturated porous rocks, with emphasis on the characterization of fracture connectivity, permeability, and porosity, and their dependence on location, direction, and scale. Over 270 single-hole tests have been conducted in six shallow vertical and inclined boreholes at the site by Guzman et al. (1996). These authors used a steady-state analysis to obtain permeability values for borehole test intervals of various lengths, based solely on late pressure data from each test. We summarize briefly the results of this earlier work and discuss more recent pressure and pressure-derivative type-curve interpretations, as well as numerical inverse analyses, of transient data from some of the single-hole tests. Our transient analyses of single-hole tests yield information about air permeability, air-filled porosity, skin factor, borehole storage, phenomenology, and dimensionality of the flow regime on a nominal scale of 1 m in the immediate vicinity of each test interval. Transient air permeabilities agree well with previously determined steady-state values, which, however, correlate poorly with fracture density data. We used the single-hole test results, together with borehole televiewer data, to help design and conduct 44 cross-hole pneumatic tests in 16 boreholes at the site (one test included 22 boreholes), including those used previously for single-hole testing. In each cross-hole test, air was injected at a constant mass flow rate into a relatively short borehole interval of length 1-2 m while monitoring (a) air pressure and temperature in the injection interval; (b) barometric pressure, air temperature, and relative humidity at the surface; and (c) air pressure and temperature in 13 short (0.5-2 m) and 24 longer (4-20 m) intervals within the injection and surrounding boreholes. We focus here on one of these cross-hole tests, labeled PP4. During this test, pressure responses were detected in 12 of the 13 short monitoring intervals and 20 of the 24 longer intervals. We used two methods to analyze the test results: a graphical matching procedure of data against newly developed pressure and pressure-derivative type-curves, and an automatic parameter estimation method based on a three-dimensional finite volume code (FEHM) coupled with an inverse code (PEST). The type-curve approach treat short and and longer intervals as points or lines, depending on distance betwee injection and monitoring intervals. The type-curve approach accounts indirectly for storage effects in monitoring intervals due to the compressibility of air. The finite volume code allows representing borehole geometry and storage more realistically, and directly, by treating each borehole as a high-permeability cylinder of finite length and radius. Analyses of pressure data from individual monitoring intervals by the two methods, under the assumption that the rock acts as a uniform and isotropic fractured porous continuum, yield comparable results.},

Conditioning takes several matrix-matrix multiplications to compute the cross-covariance matrix of the unknowns and the observations and the auto-covariance matrix of the observations. For large numbers n of discrete values of the unknown, the storage and computational costs for evaluating these matrices, proportional to n 2, become strictly inhibiting. In this paper, we summarize and extend a collection of highly efficient spectral methods to compute these matrices, based on circulant embedding and the fast Fourier transform (FFT). These methods are applicable whenever the unknowns are a stationary random variable discretized on a regular equispaced grid, imposing an exploitable structure onto the auto-covariance matrix of the unknowns. Computational costs are reduced from O (n(2))to O (n log(2) n) and storage requirements are reduced from O (n(2)) to O (n).},

Unfortunately, because the covariance matrix for parameters in reservoir models can be extremely large, calculation of the inverse can be a problem. In this paper, I discuss Jolts methods of calculating the inverse of the covariance, two of which are analytical, and two of which are purely numerical. By taking advantage of the assumed stationarity of the covariance, none of the methods require inversion of the full covariance matrix.},

If however, one wants to investigate the uncertainty of reservior behavior, one must generate a large number of realizations and ensure that the distribution of realizations properly reflects the uncertainty in reservoir properties. The most widely used method for conditioning permeability fields to production data has been the method of simulated annealing, in which practitioners attempt to minimize the difference between the ''true'' and simulated production data, and ''true'' and simulated variograms. Unfortunately, the meaning of the resulting realization is nor clear and the method can be extremely slow. In this paper, we present an alternative approach to generating realizations that are conditional to pressure data, focusing on the distribution of realizations and on the efficiency of the method. tinder certain conditions that can be verified easily, the Markov chain Monte Carlo method is known to produce stares whose frequencies of appearance correspond to a given probability distribution, so we use this method to generate the realizations. To make the method more efficient, we perturb the states in such a way that the variogram is satisfied automatically and the pressure data are approximately matched ar every step. These perturbations make use of sensitivity coefficients calculated from the reservoir simulator.},

To learn more about the behavior of variable density contaminant plumes, experiments were conducted in a flow container packed with homogeneous sand. Salt (NaI) solutions with different densities were introduced at different rates from a source, located on top of the sand, into the unconfined aquifer model where horizontal ambient groundwater streams were established with different horizontal velocities. Salt concentrations were measured with an automated, nonintrusive gamma radiation system. Results show that dense plumes were either stable or unstable. Important factors determining the stability of the dense plumes were the magnitude of the horizontal Darcy velocity and the relative density difference between the dense plume and the ambient groundwater. Longitudinal and transverse dispersivities, estimated from breakthrough curves and concentration profiles determined during the development of stable dense plumes, were small, indicating advection as the main mode of transport. Concentration profiles of stable dense plumes, taken along vertical transects, showed a rapid drop in relative concentration at the bottom of the plumes. When dense plumes became unstable, salt concentrations fluctuated considerably over time and concentration profiles of unstable plumes showed large mixing zones.},

   abstract = {Surface contaminant plumes emanating from waste disposal facilities are often denser than the ambient groundwater.  Under certain conditions these dense plumes may become unstable, contaminating larger regions of an aquifer.  The behavior of contaminant plumes with different densities was examined in three flow containers packed with homogeneous porous media simulating unconfined aquifers.  Glass beads and a medium sand were used as the porous media.  A horizontal ambient groundwater stream was established in each flow container using deionized water.  The contaminant plumes consisted of NaI or NaBr solutions introduced into each flow container from a line source located on top of the porous medium and extending over the total width of the container.  Optical tracers were added to the salt solutions to allow flow visualization.  Results show that, for a given porous medium, dense plumes were either stable or unstable depending on the magnitude of the horizontal flow velocity, the contaminant leakage rate, and the density difference between the contaminant solution and the ambient groundwater.  When a dense plume becomes unstable, lobe-shaped gravitational instabilities develop which are unsteady and three dimensional.  Our experimental results suggest that the behavior of dense contaminant plumes overlying a less dense groundwater stream in a homogeneous porous medium depends on the magnitude of certain nondimensional parameters.  It appears that gravitational instabilities begin to develop when the values of these nondimensional parameters exceed certain critical values.},

   abstract = {Shallow marine facies assemblages in the late Quaternary section of Virginia's Eastern Shore Peninsula shed new light on the relationship between mesoscale stratigraphic units (facies assemblages or "depositional systems") and the bounding surfaces from which they have been formed. These units were deposited by the coast-parallel progradation of the Pleistocene barrier spit (Eastern Shore Peninsula) during successive highstands. As a consequence, each segment of the spit complex has been produced by the coast-parallel translation of a relatively small growth area at the spit tip. The distal end of the present (Holocene) barrier system appears to closely resemble the Pleistocene highstand growth area, and this environment consequently serves as a partial analog for interpreting the depositional environment of the fossil highstand deposits.

The many facies patterns present in the spit complex can be reduced to four kinds of facies assemblages (depositional systems), adopting a process-based model (facies template). In this scheme, definitions of both "facies" and "facies assemblage" are more limited than is the case in most textbook definitions in that the facies of a given assemblage are systematically related to each other by grain size and stratal pattern, and also related to a bounding surface ("source diastem") which is the immediate source of sediment for the facies assemblage. Vertical transitions between individual facies are easily identified in outcrop, but the horizontal gradients of facies change are too gentle to be observed over the short dimensions of the borrow pits, and do not have sufficient acoustic contrast to appear on ground-penetrating radar records. However, the facies assemblages, both in the borrow pits and on radar records, stand out by virtue of their sharply defined bounding surfaces (source diastems). The facies assemblage either buries its source diastem or is capped by it.

The assemblages in the spit complex are, in ascending stratigraphic order: (1) several tidal shoal assemblages, each underlain by a channel-base diastem, (2) Two shoreface assemblages separated by an intervening marginal shoal assemblage and its underlying channel-base diastem, and (3) a beach-strandplain assemblage, underlain by a surf diastem. All of these systems prograded southward as the nose of the spit prograded, and while they did so, zones of erosion cut the bounding surfaces that separate them. Two important bounding surfaces are "conjugate" surfaces, that nourished both the facies assemblage above and the assemblage beneath. As each surface advanced, erosion at their leading edge spilled sediment forward, down the nose of the spit, while sediment was also swept backward, aiding in the burial of the surface. A conjugate surface creates a "sandwich" structure, in which two facies assemblages are separated by the generating surface. Proximal facies are back-to-back across these sediment-spreading boundaries.

Episodic progradation of the spit tip by development of successive, recurved, beach ridges has overprinted the horizontal first-order reflectors (separating facies assemblages) with gently dipping second-order reflectors that separate successive growth increments of the spit. Although less clearly defined, these growth increments are essentially high-frequency autocyclic sequences, and constitute the next higher scale of spatial organization above the depositional systems scale. The manner in which facies have been organized into depositional systems in the late Pleistocene highstand deposits of the Eastern Shore is specific to this estuary-mouth setting. These assemblages are, however, local expressions of a facies "template" that can be generalized to many other settings.},

   abstract = {Iron and Mn redistribute in soil and saprolite during weathering, The geological weathering fronts of calcareous sedimentary rock were investigated by examining the bulk density, porosity, and distribution of Ca, Fe, and Mn, Core samples were taken of soil, saprolite, and bedrock material from both summit (HHMS-4B) and sideslope (HHMS-5A) positions on an interbedded Nolichucky shale and Maryville limestone landform in Solid Waste Storage Area 6 (SWSA-6). This is a low-level radioactive solids waste disposal site on the Dept, of Energy (DOE) Oak Ridge Reservation in Roane County Tennessee, This work was initiated because data about the properties of highly weathered sedimentary rock on this site were limited, The core samples were analyzed for pH, calcium carbonate equivalence (CCE), hydroxylamine-extractable (WA) Mn, and dithionite-citrate (CBD)-extractable Fe and Mn. Low pH values occurred from the soil surface down to the depth of the oxidized and leached saprolite in both cores, The CCE and HA-extractable Mn results were also influenced by the weathering that has occurred in these zones, Extractable Mn oxide was higher at a lower depth in the oxidized and leached saprolite compared with the Fe oxide, which was higher in the overlying soil solum, Amounts of Mn oxides were higher in the sideslope core (HHMS-5A) than in the summit core (HHMS-4B), Iron was more abundant in the deeper weathered summit core, but the highest value, 39.4 g kg(-1), was found at 1.8 to 2.4 m in the sideslope core, The zone encompassing the oxidized and partially leached saprolite down to the unoxidized and unleached bedrock had higher densities and larger quantities of CaCO3 than the soil solum and oxidized and leached saprolite. The overlying soil and oxidized and leached saprolite had lower pH and CCE values and were higher in Fe and Mn oxides than the oxidized and unleached saprolite, The distribution of Fe and Mn is important when evaluating soil and saprolite for hazardous waste disposal site assessment.},

   abstract = {The watersheds at Bear Creek, Oak Ridge, TN, have similar soil-landscape relationships. The lower reaches of many of these watersheds consist of headwater riparian wetlands situated between sloping non-wetland upland zones. The objectives of this study are to examine the effects of (i) slope and geomorphic processes, (ii) human impacts, and (iii) particular characteristics of soils and saprolite that may effect drainage and water movement in the wetlands and adjacent landscapes in one of these watersheds. A transect was run from west to east in a hydrological monitored area at the lower reaches of a watershed on Bear Creek. This transect extended from a steep side slope position across a floodplain, a terrace, and a shoulder slope. On the upland positions of the Nolichucky Shale, mass wasting, overland flow and soil creep currently inhibit soil formation on the steep side slope position where a Typic Dystrudept is present, while soil stability on the shoulder slope has resulted in the formation of a well-developed Typic Hapludult. In these soils, argillic horizons occur above C horizons on less sloping gradients in comparison to steeper slopes, which have Bw horizons over Cr (saprolite) material. A riparian wetland area occupies the floodplain section, where a Typic Endoaquept is characterized by poorly drained conditions that led to the development of redoximorphic features (mottling), gleying, organic matter accumulation, and minimal development of subsurface horizons. A thin colluvial deposit overlies a thick well developed Aquic Hapludalf that formed in alluvial sediments on the terrace position. The colluvial deposit from the adjacent shoulder slope is thought to result from soil creep and anthropogenic erosion caused by past cultivation practices. Runoff from the adjacent sloping landscape and groundwater from the adjacent wetland area perhaps contribute to the somewhat poorly drained conditions of this profile. Perched watertables occur in upland positions due to dense saprolite and clay plugging in the shallow zones of the saprolite. However, no redoximorphic features are observed in the soil on the side slope due to high runoff. Remnants of the underlying shale saprolite, which occur as small discolored zones resembling mottles, are also present. The soils in the study have a CEC of <10 cmol kg (super -1) , silt loam textures and Fe (sub d) values of 0.5-4.3%. These soils are also mainly acidic and low in total carbon.},

However, l(2)-methods are known to have significant robustness advantages over l(2)-methods in many applications, and related quantile regression methods provide a useful, complementary approach to classical least-squares estimation of statistical models. Combining recent advances in interior point methods for solving linear programs with a new statistical preprocessing approach for l(1)-type problems, we obtain a 10- to 100-fold improvement in computational speeds over current (simplex-based) l(1)-algorithms in large problems, demonstrating that l(1)-methods can be made competitive with l(2)-methods in terms of computational speed throughout the entire range of problem sizes. Formal complexity results suggest that l(1)-regression can be made faster than least-squares regression for n sufficiently large and p modest.},

They are generally ill-posed problems, which means that errors in an unregularized inversion are unbounded. Instead, CONTIN seeks the optimal solution by incorporating parsimony and any statistical prior knowledge into the regularizor and absolute prior knowledge into equality and inequality constraints. This can greatly increase the resolution and accuracy of the solution. CONTIN is very flexible, consisting of a core of about 50 subprograms plus 13 small 'USER' subprograms, which the user can easily modify to specify special-purpose constraints, regularizors, operator equations, simulations, statistical weighting, etc. Special collections of USER subprograms are available for photon correlation spectroscopy, multicomponent spectra, and Fourier-Bessel, Fourier and Laplace transforms. Numerically stable algorithms are used throughout CONTIN. A fairly precise definition of information content in terms of degrees of freedom is given. The regularization parameter can be automatically chosen on the basis of an F-test and confidence region. The interpretation of the latter and of error estimates based on the covariance matrix of the constrained regularized solution are discussed. The strategies, methods and options in CONTIN are outlined. (28 refs.)},

   abstract = {Many experiments are indirect in that the observed data are linear integral (or matrix) transforms of the quantities to be estimated. These transforms typically arise because of the imperfect impulse response of the detection system or because of the indirect nature of the experiment itself. The inversion of these linear operator equations are generally ill-posed problems in that there exist a large number of possible solutions all of which fit the data to within experimental error. Therefore straightforward inversion procedures cannot be used and statistical regularization techniques are necessary. A general purpose constrained regularization method finds the simplest (most parsimonious) solution that is consistent with prior knowledge and the experimental data. The problem is formulated as a weighted least squares problem with an added quadratic form, the regularizer, which imposes parsimony (typically smoothness) or statistical prior knowledge. Numerical stable orthogonal decomposition and quadratic programming algorithms are used to obtain the unique global solution subject to any linear equality or inequality constraints imposed by prior knowledge (e.g., nonnegativity). The regularization parameter can be automatically chosen on the basis of an F-test and confidence regions. (6 refs.)},

   abstract = {A new methodology for solution of the inverse problem in groundwater hydrology is proposed and applied to a site in southeastern New Mexico with extensive hydrogeologic data. The methodology addresses the issue of nonuniqueness of the inverse solutions by generating an ensemble of transmissivity fields considered to be equally likely, each of which is in agreement with the measured transmissivity and pressure data. It consists of generating a selected number of conditionally simulated transmissivity fields and then calibrating each of the fields to match the measured steady state or transient pressures, in a least squares sense. The calibration phase involves an iterative implementation of an automated pilot point approach coupled with conditional simulations. Pilot points are the parameters of calibration. They are synthetic transmissivity data which are added to the transmissivity database to produce a revised conditional simulation during calibration. Coupled kriging and adjoint Sensitivity analysis is employed for the optimal location of pilot points, and gradient search methods are used to derive their optimal transmissivities. The pilot point methodology is well suited for characterizing the spatial variability of the transmissivity field in contrast to methods using zonation. Pilot points are located where their potential for minimizing the objective function is the highest. This minimizes the perturbations in the transmissivities which are optimally assigned to the pilot point and results in minimal changes to the covariance structure of the transmissivity field. The calibrated fields honor the transmissivity measurements at their locations, preserve the variogram, and match the measured pressures in a least squares sense. Since there are numerous options in the execution of this methodology, computational experiments have been conducted to identify the most efficient among them. The method has been applied to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) site, in southeastern New Mexico, where the U.S. Department of Energy is conducting probabilistic system assessment for the permanent disposal of transuranic nuclear waste. The resulting calibrated transmissivity fields are input to a Monte Carlo analysis of the total system performance. The present paper, paper 1 of a two-paper presentation, describes the methodology. Paper 2, a companion paper, presents the methodology's application to the WIPP site.},

To that end, an artificial neural network is used in association with a 2-D or 3-D groundwater simulation model to determine the performance of different combinations of abstraction/injection wells. Thereafter, a genetic algorithm is used to identify which of these combinations offers the least-cost solution to achieve the prescribed residual levels of pollutant within whatever timescale is specified. The resultant hybrid algorithm has been shown to be effective for a simplified but nevertheless representative problem; based on the results presented, it is expected the methodology developed will be equally applicable to large-scale, real-world situations.},

This paper will review a portion of the agricultural research that has been conducted related to soil impacts caused by the use of vehicle traffic in agricultural fields. Recommendations will also be made for ways to minimize the effects of vehicle traffic on soils when trafficking is necessary. These include: reducing axle load; reducing tractive element-soil contact stress by using radial tires, duals, and tracks; increasing soil drying prior to traffic; using conservation tillage systems which minimize vehicle traffic; using controlled traffic systems which eliminate random vehicle traffic across fields; and subsoiling to eliminate compacted soil profiles in crop growth zones. Soil compaction resulting from vehicle traffic may not be able to be completely eliminated, but it can be controlled and reduced through intelligent management of vehicle traffic.

The purpose of this technical note is to summarize these relationships for the water resources community and to illustrate their practical utility in a long-term groundwater monitoring design application. These relationships, which model the effects of the primary operators of a simple generic algorithm (selection, recombination, and mutation), provide a highly efficient method for ensuring convergence to near-optimal or optimal solutions. Application of the method to a monitoring design test case identified robust parameter values using only three trial runs.},

The plume interpolation methods considered were inverse-distance weighting, ordinary kriging, and a hybrid method that combines the two approaches. Application of the methodology to Hill Air Force Base indicated that sampling costs could be reduced by as much as 60% without significant loss in accuracy of the global mass estimates. Inverse-distance weighting was shown to be most effective as a screening tool for evaluating whether more comprehensive geostatistical modeling is warranted. The hybrid method was effective for implementing such a tiered approach, reducing computational time by more than 60% relative to kriging alone.},

   abstract = {Soil moisture controls the partitioning of moisture and energy fluxes at the land surface and is a key variable in weather and climate prediction. The performance of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for soil moisture estimation is assessed by assimilating L-band (1.4 GHz) microwave radiobrightness observations into a land surface model. An optimal smoother (a dynamic variational method) is used as a benchmark for evaluating the filter's performance. In a series of synthetic experiments the effect of ensemble size and non-Gaussian forecast errors on the estimation accuracy of the EnKF is investigated. With a state vector dimension of 4608 and a relatively small ensemble size of 30 (or 100; or 500), the actual errors in surface soil moisture at the final update time are reduced by 55% (or 70%; or 80%) from the value obtained without assimilation (as compared to 84% for the optimal smoother). For robust error variance estimates, an ensemble of at least 500 members is needed. The dynamic evolution of the estimation error variances is dominated by wetting and drying events with high variances during drydown and low variances when the soil is either very wet or very dry. Furthermore, the ensemble distribution of soil moisture is typically symmetric except under very dry or wet conditions when the effects of the nonlinearities in the model become significant. As a result, the actual errors are consistently larger than ensemble-derived forecast and analysis error variances. (32 refs.)},

   abstract = {Meaningful quantification of data and structural uncertainties in conceptual rainfall-runoff modeling is a major scientific and engineering challenge. This paper focuses on the total predictive uncertainty and its decomposition into input and structural components under different inference scenarios. Several Bayesian inference schemes are investigated, differing in the treatment of rainfall and structural uncertainties, and in the precision of the priors describing rainfall uncertainty. Compared with traditional lumped additive error approaches, the quantification of the total predictive uncertainty in the runoff is improved when rainfall and/or structural errors are characterized explicitly. However, the decomposition of the total uncertainty into individual sources is more challenging. In particular, poor identifiability may arise when the inference scheme represents rainfall and structural errors using separate probabilistic models. The inference becomes ill-posed unless sufficiently precise prior knowledge of data uncertainty is supplied; this ill-posedness can often be detected from the behavior of the Monte Carlo sampling algorithm. Moreover, the priors on the data quality must also be sufficiently accurate if the inference is to be reliable and support meaningful uncertainty decomposition. Our findings highlight the inherent limitations of inferring inaccurate hydrologic models using rainfall-runoff data with large unknown errors. Bayesian total error analysis can overcome these problems using independent prior information. The need for deriving independent descriptions of the uncertainties in the input and output data is clearly demonstrated.},

These so-called self-potential signals can be used to track the pattern of groundwater flow in the subsurface. A field test was performed using a set of 53 Pb/PbCl{sub 2} electrodes plus an additional electrode used as a unique reference in the field and a set of five piezometers to monitor the position of the piezometric surface. Using appropriate Green's functions, the electrical response is analyzed in terms of piezometric head distribution. This new methodology, which we call "electrography," allows visualization of preferential fluid flow pathways and the distribution of heads during pumping test experiments. Using a conditioning technique, this method could allow inversion of the hydraulic conductivity distribution around a pumping well. (49 refs.)},

The model includes an accurate physical description of water/steam and air process streams. These together with EO models for the required unit operations were used to optimize two utility systems: a small model containing two steam turbines and a larger model of a combined heat and power plant. The applicability of the model was established using a novel SQP (Sequential Quadratic Programming) method which employs a `tolerance tube' approach (Zoppke-Donaldson, A Tolerance-Tube Approach to Sequential Quadratic Programming with Applications, PhD thesis, 1995) to decide whether to accept a step from the QP subproblem. Comparison was then made with a further new penalty-free optimization method named filterSQP (Nonlinear Programming without a Penalty Function, 1997), which was used to solve the model containing two steam turbines. The tuning of both the model and the use of filterSQP were further explored with numerical experiments on the effect of scaling; comparison of dense and sparse versions of filterSQP: and different initial sizes for the trust region. Also, the correctness is demonstrated of the shadow price given by the SQP code for the steam generation temperature. The results show that the sparse filterSQP solver works very efficiently and provides a basis for modelling and optimization of larger, industrial size problems which are reported in a companion paper.

Using it, we investigate the influence of flowmeter induced hydraulic head losses and filter pack effects on the calculated drawdown distributions in the vicinity of the pumping well and on the flowmeter test estimates of layer horizontal hydraulic conductivity, K (sub i) , in three different aquifer-well systems: a homogeneous aquifer; a homogeneous aquifer with a filter pack surrounding the well; and a two-layer aquifer with a filter pack surrounding the well. We confirm that the K (sub i) estimates can be significantly biased due to the head loss across the flowmeter. This head loss induces a non-uniform flow pattern in the vicinity of the well, which violates the horizontal flow assumption invoked by flowmeter test interpretation methodologies. The effect of the hydraulic head losses alone (i.e. no cross-flow through the filter pack) can lead to K (sub i) estimation errors as great as a factor of three even in a homogeneous aquifer. The coupled effect of hydraulic head losses and cross-flow through the filter pack can lead to K (sub i) estimation errors of up to a factor of 10 or greater. In actual flowmeter tests, these head losses can be reduced by increasing the annulus of the flowmeter, by operating the flowmeter without a packer, or by choosing a small enough pumping rate.},

We also need methods to incorporate data-independent prior information to eliminate unreasonable models that fit the data. Both of these issues involve subtle choices that may significantly influence the results of inverse calculations. The specification of prior information is especially controversial. How does one quantify information? What does it mean to know something about a parameter a priori? In this tutorial we discuss Bayesian and frequentist methodologies that can be used to incorporate information into inverse calculations. In particular we show that apparently conservative Bayesian choices, such as representing interval constraints by uniform probabilities (as is commonly done when using genetic algorithms, for example) may lead to artificially small uncertainties. We also describe tools from statistical decision theory that can be used to characterize the performance of inversion algorithms.},

   abstract = {The objective of this study was to examine chemical changes in porewaters that occur over small scales (cm) as groundwater flows through the hyporheic zone and discharges to a stream in a temperate forest of northern Wisconsin. Hyporheic-zone porewaters were sampled at discrete depths of 2, 10, 15, 61, and 183 cm at three study sites in the study basin. Chemical profiles of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), CO2, CH4, and pH show dramatic changes between 61 cm sediment depth and the water-sediment interface. Unless discrete samples at small depth intervals are taken, these chemical profiles are not accounted for. Similar trends were observed at the three study locations, despite each site having very different hydraulic-flow regimes. Increases in DOC concentration by an order of magnitude from 61 to 15 cm depth with a corresponding decrease in pH and rapid decreases in the molecular weight of the DOC suggest that aliphatic compounds (likely organic acids) are being generated in the hyporheic zone. Estimated efflux rates of DOG, CO2, and CH4 to the stream are 6.2, 0.79, 0.13 moles m(2) d(-1), respectively, with the vast majority of these materials produced in the hyporheic zone. Very little of these materials are accounted for by sampling stream water, suggesting rapid uptake and/or volatilization.},

The results indicated rapid consumption of injected O2 or NO3- in shallow and deep test intervals across a large portion of the site. Computed first-order rate coefficients for aerobic respiration ranged from 0.15 to 1.69 h-1 in the shallow test interval, and from 0.08 to 0.83 h-1 in the deep test interval. The largest aerobic respiration rates occurred on the upgradient edge of the contaminant plume where concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons and dissolved O2 were relatively high. Computed first-order rate coefficients for denitrification ranged from 0.09 to 0.42 h-1 in the shallow test interval, and from 0.11 to 0.28 h-1 in the deep test interval. The largest denitrification rates occurred on the downgradient edge of the plume where hydrocarbon concentrations were relatively high but dissolved oxygen concentrations were small. The rates reported here represent maximal rates of aerobic respiration and denitrification, as supported by high concentrations of electron acceptors in the injected test solutions. Production of dissolved CO2 during aerobic respiration and denitrification tests provided evidence that O2 and NO3- consumption was largely due to microbial activity. Additional evidence for microbial NO3- consumption was provided by reduced rates of NO3- consumption when dissolved O2 was injected with NO3- and by increased N2O production when C2H2 was injected with NO3-.},

   abstract = {More efficient methods are needed for the in situ evaluation of solute sorption to aquifer sediments. The objective of this study was to develop a simplified method for estimating retardation factors for injected solutes from `push-pull' test extraction phase breakthrough curves (BTCs). Sensitivity analyses based on numerical simulations were used to evaluate the method performance for a variety of test conditions. Simulations were conducted for varying retardation factors, aquifer parameters and injection phase durations, for tests performed under nonideal transport conditions such as nonlinear equilibrium and linear nonequilibrium sorption, and for a test performed in a physically heterogeneous aquifer. Predicted retardation factors showed errors <=14% in tests performed under ideal transport conditions (physically homogeneous aquifer with spatially uniform dispersivity that does not vary from solute to solute, spatially uniform linear equilibrium sorption). The method performed more poorly for solutes with large retardation factors (R>20) and for tests conducted under nonideal transport conditions, and is expected to perform poorly in aquifers with highly heterogeneous sorption. In an example application, we used the method to estimate the distribution coefficient for {sup 85}Sr using data from a field test performed by Pickens JF, Jackson RE, Inch KJ, Merritt WF. Reasonable agreement was found between distribution coefficients obtained using the simplified method of estimation and those obtained by Pickens et al. (1981). (37 Refs.)},

   abstract = {In geostatistical inverse modeling, hydrogeological parameters, such as hydraulic conductivity, are estimated as spatial fields. Upon discretization this results in several thousand (log-)hydraulic conductivity values to be estimated. Common inversion schemes rely on gradient-based parameter estimation methods which require the sensitivity of all measurements with respect to all parameters. Point-like measurements of steady-state concentration in aquifers are generally not well suited for gradient-based methods, because typical plumes exhibit only a very narrow fringe at which the concentration decreases from a maximal value to zero. Only here the sensitivity of concentration with respect to hydraulic conductivity significantly differs from zero. Thus, if point-like measurements of steady-state concentration do not lie in this narrow fringe, their sensitivity with respect to hydraulic conductivity is zero. Observations of concentrations averaged over a larger control volume, by contrast, show a more regular sensitivity pattern. We thus suggest artificially increasing the sampling volume of steady-state concentration measurements for the evaluation of sensitivities in early stages of an iterative parameter estimation scheme. We present criteria for the extent of artificially increasing the sampling volume and for decreasing it when the simulation results converge to the measurements. By this procedure, we achieve high stability in geostatistical inversion of steady-state concentration measurements. The uncertainty of the estimated parameter fields is evaluated by generating conditional realizations.},

   abstract = {Growing demand for corn due to the expansion of ethanol has increased concerns that environmentally sensitive lands retired from agricultural production and enrolled into the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) will be cropped again. Iowa produces more ethanol than any other state in the United States, and it also produces the most corn. Thus, an examination of the impacts of higher crop prices on CRP land in Iowa can give insight into what we might expect nationally in the years ahead if crop prices remain high. We construct CRP land supply curves for various corn prices and then estimate the environmental impacts of cropping CRP land through the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model. EPIC provides edge-of-field estimates of soil erosion, nutrient loss, and carbon sequestration. We find that incremental impacts increase dramatically as higher corn prices bring into production more and more environmentally fragile land. Maintaining current levels of environmental quality will require substantially higher spending levels. Even allowing for the cost savings that would accrue as CRP land leaves the program, a change in targeting strategies will likely be required to ensure that the most sensitive land does not leave the program.},

   abstract = {In performance assessment studies of radioactive waste disposal in crystalline rocks, one source of uncertainty is the appropriateness of conceptual models of the physical processes contributing to the potential transport of radionuclides. The Alternative Models Project (AMP) evaluates the uncertainty of models of groundwater flow, an uncertainty that arises from alternative conceptualisations of groundwater movement in fractured media. The AMP considers three modelling approaches for simulating flow and advective transport from the waste canisters to the biosphere: Stochastic Continuum, Discrete Fracture Network, and Channel Network. Each approach addresses spatial variability via Monte Carlo simulation, whose realisations are summarised by the statistics of three simplified measures of geosphere performance: travel time, transport resistance (a function of travel distance, flow-wetted surface per volume of rock, and Darcy velocity along a flowpath), and canister flux (Darcy velocity at repository depth). The AMP uses a common reference case defined by a specific model domain, boundary conditions, and layout of a hypothetical repository, with a consistent set of summary statistics to facilitate the comparison of the three approaches. The three modelling approaches predict similar median travel times and median canister fluxes, but dissimilar variability. The three modelling approaches also predict similar values for minimum travel time and maximum canister flux, and predict similar locations for particles exiting the geosphere. The results suggest that the problem specifications (i.e. boundary conditions and gross hydrogeology) constrain the flow modelling, limiting the impact of this conceptual uncertainty on performance assessment.},

Currently available methods for plume estimation cannot fully take advantage of prior knowledge of flow and transport information or the location of a contaminant source. This paper presents two new geostatistical tools for incorporating transport information in estimating the spatial distribution of groundwater contaminant plumes. The methods account for the spatial/temporal covariance of the contaminant plume in defining a best estimate of the plume distribution and its associated uncertainty. Overall, the methods require that the estimated plume distribution be physically feasible given both the available concentration measurements and the flow and transport in the affected aquifer. Sample applications in homogeneous and heterogeneous formations are presented. Even with relatively few observations, the new methods yield results that are superior to those obtained by kriging, with a better reproduction of the true plume shape and lower uncertainty.},

   abstract = {A new global optimization algorithm for functions of many continuous variables is presented, derived from the basic simulated annealing method. Our main contribution lies in dealing with high-dimensionality minimization problems, which are often difficult to solve by all known minimization methods with or without gradient. In this article, we take a special interest in the variables discretization issue. We also develop and implement several complementary stopping criteria. The original Metropolis iterative random search, which takes place in a Euclidean space R{sup n}, is replaced by another similar exploration, performed within a succession of Euclidean spaces R{sup p}, with p<<n. This enhanced simulated annealing (ESA) algorithm was validated first on classical highly multimodal functions of 2 to 100 variables. We obtained significant reductions in the number of function evaluations compared to six other global optimization algorithms, selected according to previously published computational results for the same set of test functions. In most cases, ESA was able to closely approximate known global optima. The reduced ESA computational cost helped us to refine further the obtained global results, through the use of some local search. We have used this new minimizing procedure to solve complex circuit design problems, for which the objective function evaluation can be exceedingly costly. (29 refs.)},

   pages = {2675-2688},
   abstract = {A stochastic-convective reactive (SCR) transport method is developed for one-dimensional steady transport in physically heterogeneous media with nonlinear degradation. The method is free of perturbation amplitude limitations and circumvents the difficulty of scale dependence of phenomenological parameters by avoiding volume-averaged specifications of diffusive/dispersive fluxes. The transport system is conceptualized as an ensemble of independent convective-reactive streamlines, each characterized by a randomized convective velocity (or travel time). Dispersive effects are treated as a component of the randomness in the streamline velocity ensemble, so no explicit expression for hydrodynamic dispersive flux is written in the streamline transport equation. The expected value of the transport over the stream tube ensemble is obtained as an average of solutions to the reactive convection equation according to the stream tube (travel time) probability distribution function. In this way, transport with reaction can be expressed in terms of global-scale random variables, such as solute travel time and travel distance, which are integrals of the stochastic variables such as velocity. Derivations support the hypothesis that via the SCR the decay process can be factored out of the mechanical transport behavior (as reflected by movement of a passive tracer) and scaled independently. Solution strategies are presented for general linear and nonlinear kinetic reactions. Demonstration simulations show that for Fickian transport with nonlinear reactions the SCR and convection dispersion equation can give different results. Ginn et al. (this issue) extend the SCR solution to coupled nonlinear equations, to accommodate Michaelis-Menten biodegradation of solute with an accounting of microbial growth.},

   abstract = {[1] Cross-well electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) was used to monitor the migration of a saline tracer in a two-well pumping-injection experiment conducted at the Massachusetts Military Reservation in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. After injecting 2200 mg/L of sodium chloride for 9 hours, ERT data sets were collected from four wells every 6 hours for 20 days. More than 180,000 resistance measurements were collected during the tracer test. Each ERT data set was inverted to produce a sequence of 3-D snapshot maps that track the plume. In addition to the ERT experiment a pumping test and an infiltration test were conducted to estimate horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity values. Using modified moment analysis of the electrical conductivity tomograms, the mass, center of mass, and spatial variance of the imaged tracer plume were estimated. Although the tomograms provide valuable insights into field-scale tracer migration behavior and aquifer heterogeneity, standard tomographic inversion and application of Archie's law to convert electrical conductivities to solute concentration results in underestimation of tracer mass. Such underestimation is attributed to ( 1) reduced measurement sensitivity to electrical conductivity values with distance from the electrodes and ( 2) spatial smoothing ( regularization) from tomographic inversion. The center of mass estimated from the ERT inversions coincided with that given by migration of the tracer plume using 3-D advective-dispersion simulation. The 3-D plumes seen using ERT exhibit greater apparent dispersion than the simulated plumes and greater temporal spreading than observed in field data of concentration breakthrough at the pumping well.},

Unique aspects of Wisconsin agriculture present opportunities to optimize the energy efficiency and greenhouse gas neutrality of corn ethanol fuel when all aspects of corn and ethanol production and co-product use are tightly integrated. The Biofuel Energy Systems Simulator was used to perform life-cycle analysis on Wisconsin ethanol plants as determined by surveys. A displacement co-product crediting method was developed to reflect the use of distillers grains in dairy rations within the state. We estimate that the ethanol fuel currently produced in Wisconsin has a net energy ratio of 1.58 and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 46% when compared to gasoline. The net energy ratio increased to 1.92 and emissions decreased by 16% when all co-products were assumed to be fed in wet form to dairy cows within 64 km of the distillation plant. The impact of displacing natural gas with biogas from the digestion of the manure from the cows fed by-product was not significant. Wisconsin corn ethanol life-cycle analysis was decidedly sensitive to lime and nitrogen inputs. Reducing these inputs by applying and crediting the nutrients and potential alkalinity in dairy manure to corn production increased the net energy ratio to 2.00 and further decreased emissions by 9%. Significantly more favorable results were found when ethanol industry standard and average values were used instead of our survey data, highlighting potential errors from non-site-specific analysis.},

   abstract = {Solute transport in soils can be described in terms of solute travel time probability density functions (pdfs). In the past, parameterized functional forms for the travel time pdf have been derived based on models of physical transport processes and the properties of the soil, or have been obtained from observed transport behavior. Alternatively, a nonparametric pdf for a particular soil can be measured experimentally. In general, this measurement requires deconvoluting the pdf, which is mathematically an ill-posed problem. In this paper we perform the deconvolution using a constrained regularization approach. The regularization method uses a basis function representation of the travel time pdf which eliminates numerical problems associated with the standard regularization approach. The method is tested using synthetic and experimental data. Regularized solutions are evaluated using Provencher's (Provencher, 1982a) F test statistic along with a visual inspection of their fit to the data. We analyze data from previously published field experiments and the results suggest multimodal travel time pdfs may be appropriate for modeling transport in soils. (23 Refs.)},

   abstract = {A high resolution, cross-borehole, 3D electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) study of solute transport was conducted in a large experimental tank. ERT voxels comprising the time sequence of electrical images were converted into a 3D array of ERT estimated fluid conductivity breakthrough curves and compared with direct measurements of fluid conductivity breakthrough made in wells. The 3D ERT images of solute transport behaviour were also compared with predictions based on a 3D finite-element, coupled flow and transport model, accounting for gravity induced flow caused by concentration differences. The tank (dimensions 185 x 245 x 186 cm) was filled with medium sand, with a gravel channel and a fine sand layer installed. This heterogeneous system was designed to complicate solute transport behaviour relative to a homogeneous sand tank, and to thus provide a challenging but insightful analysis of the ability of 3D ERT to resolve transport phenomena. Four ERT arrays and 20 piezometers were installed during filling. A NaCl tracer (conductivity 1.34 S/m) was injected and intensively monitored with 3D ERT and direct sampling of fluid chemistry in piezometers. We converted the bulk conductivity estimate for 250 voxels in the ERT imaged volume into ERT estimated voxel fluid conductivity by assuming that matrix conduction in the tank is negligible. In general, the ERT voxel response is in reasonable agreement with the shape of fluid conductivity breakthrough observed in six wells in which direct measurements of fluid conductivity were made. However, discrepancies occur, particularly at early times, which we attribute to differences between the scale of the image voxels and the fluid conductivity measurement, measurement errors mapped into the electrical inversion and artificial image roughness resulting from the inversion. ERT images revealed the 3D tracer distribution at 15 times after tracer injection. The general pattern and timing of solute breakthrough observed with ERT agreed with that predicted from the flow/transport modelling. However, the ERT images indicate a vertical component of tracer transport and preferential flow paths in the medium sand: We attribute this to transient vertical gradients established during tracer injection, and heterogeneity caused by sorting of the sand resulting from the filling procedure. In this study, ERT provided a unique dataset of 250 voxel breakthrough curves in 1.04 m(3). The use of 3D ERT to generate an array of densely sampled estimated fluid conductivity breakthrough curves is a potentially powerful tool for quantifying solute transport processes.

   abstract = {Electric imaging of tracer tests can provide valuable information on the spatial variability of solute transport processes. This concept was investigated by cross-borehole electrical imaging of a controlled release in an experimental tank. A saline tracer (conductivity 8 MU 10{sup 3} ms/m volume 270 1) was injected into a tank facility (dimensions 10 MU 10 MU 3 m) consisting of alternating sand and clay layers. Injection was from 0.3 m below the surface, at a point where maximum interaction between tank structure and tracer transport was expected. Repeated imaging over a two-week period detected non-uniform tracer transport, partly caused by the sand/clay sequence. Tracer accumulation on two clay layers was observed and density-driven spill of tracer over a clay shelf was imaged. An additional unexpected flow pathway, probably caused by complications during array installation, was identified close to an electrode array. Pore water samples obtained following termination of electrical imaging generally supported the observed electrical response, although discrepancies arose when analysing the response of individual pixels. The pixels that make up the electrical images were interpreted as a large number of breakthrough curves. The shape of the pixel breakthrough-recession curve allowed some quantitative interpretation of solute travel time, as well as a qualitative assessment of spatial variability in advective-dispersive transport characteristics across the image plane. Although surface conduction effects associated with the clay layers complicated interpretation, the plotting of pixel breakthroughs was considered a useful step in the hydrological interpretation of the tracer test. The spatial coverage provided by the high density of pixels is the factor that most encourages the approach. (24 Refs.)},

   abstract = {Hydraulic potential, solution of the groundwater flow equation, is submitted to several types of uncertainties. These uncertainties are found not only in the parameters of the flow equation and in the boundary conditions, but also in the structure of the geological medium. This [`]structure uncertainty' comes from the necessary interpolation between borehole information or seismic information at different locations of the geological site. In the case of parameter uncertainties, sensitivity coefficients are usually evaluated in order to solve an inverse problem based on the knowledge of measures of hydraulic potential at locations sparsely distributed in the flow region. We propose, in this paper, to apply the same principle to structure uncertainty, that is, to calculate explicitly (under some hypotheses) the sensitivity coefficients of hydraulic potential for displacements of interfaces delimiting successive geological layers. Therefore, we have derived a first order variational formula which is used for the solution of the inverse problem in an iterative algorithm. Some iterations are used to reduce the effects of approximations made in the variational formula. The algorithm is described and numerical results are discussed for test problems.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a geostatistical approach to multi-directional aquifer stimulation in order to better identify the transmissivity field. Hydraulic head measurements, taken at a few locations but under a number of different steady-state flow conditions, are used to estimate the transmissivity. Well installation is generally the most costly aspect of obtaining hydraulic head measurements. Therefore, it is advantageous to obtain as many informative measurements from each sampling location as possible. This can be achieved by hydraulically stimulating the aquifer through pumping, in order to set-up a variety of flow conditions. We illustrate the method by applying it to a synthetic aquifer. The simulations provide evidence that a few sampling locations may provide enough information to estimate the transmissivity field. Furthermore, the innovation of, or new information provided by, each measurement can be examined by looking at the corresponding spline and sensitivity matrix. Estimates from multi-directional stimulation are found to be clearly superior to estimates using data taken under one flow condition. We describe the geostatistical methodology for using data from multi-directional simulations and address computational issues.},

   pages = {376-389},
   abstract = {Control of ground water plays an important part in operations at many open pit mines. Selection of an efficient and cost-effective ground-water control program is frequently complicated by the complex and somewhat uncertain hydrogeologic environment found at most mine sites. This paper documents a case study of dewatering operations at Highland Valley Copper that shows how risk-cost-benefit analysis can be used to identify the best ground-water control strategy to improve stability of pit walls under such conditions. For each of a specified set of design alternatives, the analysis involves evaluation of an economic objective function, comprised of revenues, operating costs, and monetary risks associated with slope failure. The risk calculation requires an accurate estimate of the probability of slope failure on the pit wall. The calculation involves a coupled, steady-state, saturated-unsaturated, finite-element ground-water flow model and a limit equilibrium slope stability model. The coupled model is invoked in a conditional Monte Carlo simulation that is based on a geostatistical description of the level of uncertainty inherent in the available hydrogeological and geotechnical data. Although the emphasis in this paper is on identifying the optimum slope angle and ground-water control strategy for open pit mines, the framework is equally well-suited to the analysis of design issues for any engineering projects in which the hydrogeological environment plays an important role.},

It is shown that the two-component CDE model can be reformulated as an integral equation for the 'fast' solute component which has the same form and interpretation as the TFM integral equation specialized to steady water flow conditions and solute input or loss restricted to the entrance or exit surface of a soil unit. The travel time probability density function (PDF) for a solute according to the two-component CDE model then is calculated analytically as a Laplace transform. Numerical inversion of the transformed PDF is carried out for several different sets of values of the four adjustable parameters in the CDE model. The effects of convection, dispersion, and linear sorption processes, as well as the influence of the 'slow' solute component, are illustrated by the numerically simulated travel time PDF.

During the test, we pumped water out from the aquifer at one well and monitored the water level changes at the rest of the wells to obtain a set of five well hydrographs. By pumping at another of the six wells, we obtained another set of five hydrographs. This procedure was repeated until each of the six wells was pumped. We then analyzed the six sets of hydrographs using the classical drawdown-time, the drawdown-distance, and the drawdown-distance/time methods. Results of the analysis confirm recent findings that the transmissivity estimates vary significantly at early time and stabilize at late time. At late time, the estimated values from all hydrographs are similar overall but vary slightly according to the locations of the pumping and observation wells. In contrast, storage coefficient estimates stabilized rapidly to distinct values associated with the well locations. We subsequently used a hydraulic tomography approach to include all hydrographs from the sequential aquifer test to estimate the spatially varying transmissivity and storage coefficient fields. The estimated fields appear to be realistic: They reflect the geologic setting and the behaviors of the well hydrographs, although more definitive confirmation is needed.},

While attempting to solve a related problem, this study presents a novel procedure that combines genetic algorithms with geostatistical theory. The proposed method is compared to other methods that also integrate geostatistical theory with other optimization schemes, including the sequential design method (SDM), branch and bound method (BBM) and non-linear programming method (NPM). Those methods are implemented and applied to a simplified field case. The finding indicates that the BBM method is computationally infeasible for practical applications even if it can obtain the global optimal solution in principle. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are characterized by their ability to obtain a set of near optimal solutions instead of a single solution. In general, the total variations among the network defined by these methods do not significantly differ. For a network design problem, the SDM method provides a computationally efficient solution for a preliminary study. On the other hand, the multiple choices given by the GAs provide decision makers with flexibility to consider factors that geostatistics can not.},

   abstract = {In this paper, a stochastic approach is developed for solving the inverse problem of parameter identification for transient groundwater flow. Adjoint state equations are derived for the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) relating transient head and log hydraulic conductivity perturbations. The derived equations can be used to calculate the covariance matrix of head observations and the cross-covariance matrix between head observations and log hydraulic conductivity measurements for each observation time, as well as the covariance and cross-covariance matrices between different observation times. The number of simulation runs required for obtaining these matrices is equal to the number of head observations. The reliability of model prediction is evaluated through the variance estimate method using adjoint sensitivity analysis and the cokriging estimate. The reliability evaluation of model prediction can be used as an aid in the optimization of experimental design for sampling strategies. A numerical example is given to illustrate the stochastic inverse procedure for a general transient flow problem. The example shows that using head observations of all observation times simultaneously produces much better results than using them sequentially (commonly known as the quasi-steady approach). The example also shows that it is possible to obtain a reliable stochastic inverse solution for meeting a given prediction objective based on a limited number of observations.},

Because there are crossover effects between state variables and parmeters, coupled inverse problems are different from single inverse problems in several aspects, especially in the selection of objective functions, identifiability, and experimental design. This paper discusses the general definition of coupled inverse problems posed in the framework of multiobjective optimization. In order to obtain gradient vectors of objective functions as well as all sensitivity coefficients, a general procedure for deriving the adjoint state equations and their associated conditions is described. Using the rules of adjoint operation presented in this paper, the derivation of adjoint problems becomes very easy, even for nonlinear and transient coupled problems. As examples, the adjoint problem of flow-mass transport (or flow-heat transport), the adjoint problem of saltwater intrusion, and the adjoint problem of two-phase flow are derived. Numerical experiments on a two-dimensional flow-mass transport problem are given to explain the procedure of sensitivity analysis and parameter identification for coupled problems. The hydraulic conductivity can be identified by using observations of head and/or solute concentration.},

The method is developed for a sparsely fractured rock with a conductivity field that is dominated by major fractures and fracture zones. For such a fracture system it is believed that an accurate description of the correlation and anisotropy structure is essential. The proposed method will capture these features of the fracture system. The basic approach of the method is to evaluate accurate cell conductivity values for a staggered grid arrangement, i.e. velocities are stored at cell walls and scalars at cell centres. The balance of forces, i.e. the Darcy law, is evaluated for a control volume centred around the point where the velocity component is stored. Fractures are assumed to have a thickness and conductivity. The conductivity of a velocity control volume is calculated from the intersecting volume between the fracture and the velocity control volume. Intersecting volumes, with their respective conductivities, are added up to form the control volume conductivity. The general conclusion is that the method results in accurate simulations. It is expected that the method can be utilised in many practical groundwater simulations. This statement is based on the results from three test cases with analytical solution and one test case where results are compared with those from established theories.},

It is argued that the resulting conductivity fields capture the correlation and anisotropy structures, as well as the mean conductivity, of the rock in a realistic way. The main objective is to evaluate if the suggested method can be used in an application to a real site. The objective is formulated in three questions: "Can the method utilize available field data?", "Can the generated fields be calibrated and conditioned?" and "Are realistic distributions of pressure, flow and density obtained?". From the application to the Aspo HRL, it is concluded that the hydraulic conductivity fields, generated by the suggested method, can utilize field data and be calibrated. It is also demonstrated that realistic distributions of pressure, flow and density can be simulated.},

   abstract = {Extensive explorations have been performed in the northern part of the island of Dugi Otok in the Adriatic Sea (Croatia) with the purpose of extraction of fresh and/or brackish water. The island is predominantly composed of karstified carbonate rocks of the Cretaceous age. The explorations included geological and hydrogeological mapping of the area, geophysical surveys (by means of the geoelectric tomography method, electrical resistivity sounding, and surface seismic refraction), exploratory core drilling, hydrochemical in situ and laboratory explorations, and the pumping test with the calculation of rock mass parameters. Based on the obtained results, it was concluded that it is possible to exploit the groundwater with a pumping quantity of 5 l/s without intrusion of salt water into the fresh-water tens. Choosing a pumping regime based on the parameters of the aquifer (rock mass hydraulic conductivity order of magnitude 10(-4)-10(-6) m/s), and knowing the parameters of the well, as well as the tidal efficiency, should reduce the possibility of intrusion to the minimum. Because of the systematic quality of the performed explorations and obtained results, the island of Dugi Otok can serve as a typical example for such kinds of exploration works on other karstic islands. Hydrogeological composition behaves partly according to Ghyben-Herzberg's law, but because of the nature of the karstic hydrogeological system, such a statement needs to be accepted approximately because of the highly complicated relationships.

   abstract = {A tracer-elution experiment was conducted in a 9-m-thick alluvial sand aquifer at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, Denver, Colorado, within an extensive 1,1,1-trichloroethane and trichloroethene plume. The forced-gradient flow field was controlled by an injection well and an extraction well separated by 8.4 m and aligned in the direction of the natural-gradient flow. Upon extraction, the contaminant-laden water was treated by air stripping and reinjected into the injection well. Iodide tracer was added to the injection flow during the initial 27.5 h of the experiment. Tracer transport and organic contaminant elution were monitored by four 0.15-m-screened drive points and a fully penetrating monitoring well. Relative permeabilities, dispersivities and retardation factors were estimated from tracer breakthrough and contaminant elution curves by the moment method and by curve-fitting with an advection-dispersion model. Tracer transport through the four strata sampled by the drive points indicated a permeability variation of three orders of magnitude. Contaminant elution was not observed in the lowest-permeability stratum monitored during the experiment. In all monitored strata, contaminant elution was controlled primarily by permeability effects on water flow and exhibited minimal retardation or desorption effects. The fully penetrating monitoring well exhibited a tracer response primarily from the more permeable strata with the addition of tracer from the less permeable strata producing an increased breakthrough spreading. This increased spreading or dispersion was reflected in a higher longitudinal dispersivity estimate (1.2 m assuming a homogeneous aquifer) than dispersivity estimates from the drive-point sampler tracer curves (ranging from 5 to 21 cm). Contaminant elution curves from the fully penetrating monitoring well exhibited an initial response primarily from the more permeable strata (rapid elution of contaminants) and provided no insight into the elution response of the majority of the aquifer strata. Low mass recoveries of tracer within low-permeability layers are suspected to be due to the initial transient flow field and/or the initially high range of hydraulic conductivities along the injection well screen.},

We use nonlinear simulation-regression applied to a transient groundwater flow model to estimate parameter values and their uncertainties and use steady state flow path analyses to confirm the model's consistency with the location of contaminants. Parameter uncertainty is translated into flow model prediction uncertainty using a first-order Taylor series approximation. Optimal minimum-pumping strategies for steady state hydraulic containment of the plume are designed, and model prediction uncertainty is accounted for with stochastic programming. It is impossible to achieve a reliability level higher than 60% using only two pumping wells. For the 10-well case, pumping rates must increase about 40% to extend reliability from 50 to 90%. Monte Carlo analyses indicate that for the 10-well 90% reliability formulation, the first-order method of propagating uncertainty results in a solution with accurate performance reliabilities. We find that the coefficient of variation in hydraulic gradient dictates whether the probabilistic constraints are obeyed. Comparison of the probabilistic constraint and ''safety factor'' approaches to overcoming model uncertainty reveals that the ability of probabilistic constraints to accommodate local variations in model prediction uncertainty is highly important. Postoptimization solute transport studies show that increased reliability levels for hydraulic containment do not necessarily translate into faster plume cleanup times.},

The OPR statistic measures the change in prediction uncertainty produced when an observation is added to or removed from an existing monitoring network, and it can be used to guide refinement and enhancement of the network. Prediction uncertainty is approximated using a first-order second-moment method. We apply the OPR statistic to a model of the Death Valley regional groundwater flow system (DVRFS) to evaluate the importance of existing and potential hydraulic head observations to predicted advective transport paths in the saturated zone underlying Yucca Mountain and underground testing areas on the Nevada Test Site. Important existing observations tend to be far from the predicted paths, and many unimportant observations are in areas of high observation density. These results can be used to select locations at which increased observation accuracy would be beneficial and locations that could be removed from the network. Important potential observations are mostly in areas of high hydraulic gradient far from the paths. Results for both existing and potential observations are related to the flow system dynamics and coarse parameter zonation in the DVRFS model. If system properties in different locations are as similar as the zonation assumes, then the OPR results illustrate a data collection opportunity whereby observations in distant, high-gradient areas can provide information about properties in flatter-gradient areas near the paths. If this similarity is suspect, then the analysis produces a different type of data collection opportunity involving testing of model assumptions critical to the OPR results.},

   abstract = {[1] Calibrated models of groundwater systems can provide substantial information for guiding data collection. This work considers using such models to guide hydrogeologic data collection for improving model predictions by identifying model parameters that are most important to the predictions. Identification of these important parameters can help guide collection of field data about parameter values and associated flow system features and can lead to improved predictions. Methods for identifying parameters important to predictions include prediction scaled sensitivities (PSS), which account for uncertainty on individual parameters as well as prediction sensitivity to parameters, and a new "value of improved information'' (VOII) method presented here, which includes the effects of parameter correlation in addition to individual parameter uncertainty and prediction sensitivity. In this work, the PSS and VOII methods are demonstrated and evaluated using a model of the Death Valley regional groundwater flow system. The predictions of interest are advective transport paths originating at sites of past underground nuclear testing. Results show that for two paths evaluated the most important parameters include a subset of five or six of the 23 defined model parameters. Some of the parameters identified as most important are associated with flow system attributes that do not lie in the immediate vicinity of the paths. Results also indicate that the PSS and VOII methods can identify different important parameters. Because the methods emphasize somewhat different criteria for parameter importance, it is suggested that parameters identified by both methods be carefully considered in subsequent data collection efforts aimed at improving model predictions.},

   abstract = {We simulate three types of forced-gradient tracer tests (converging radial flow, unequal strength two well, and equal strength two well) and natural-gradient tracer tests in multiple realizations of heterogeneous two-dimensional aquifers with a hydraulic conductivity distribution characterized by a spherical variogram. We determine longitudinal dispersivities ({alpha}{sub L}) by analysis of forced-gradient test breakthrough curves at the pumped well and by spatial moment analysis of tracer concentrations during the natural-gradient tests. Results show that among the forced-gradient tests, a converging radial-flow test tends to yield the smallest {alpha}{sub L}, an equal strength two-well test tends to yield the largest {alpha}{sub L}, and an unequal strength two-well test tends to yield an intermediate value. This finding is qualitatively explained by considering the aquifer area sampled by a particular test. A converging radial-flow test samples a small area, and thus the tracer undergoes a low degree of spreading and mixing. An equal strength two-well test samples a much larger area, so the tracer is spread and mixed to a greater degree. Results also suggest that if the distance between the tracer source well and the pumped well is short relative to the lengths over which velocity is correlated, then the {alpha}{sub } estimate can be highly dependent on local heterogeneities in the vicinity of the wells. Finally, results indicate that {alpha}{sub L} estimated from forced-gradient tracer tests can significantly underestimate the {alpha}{sub L} needed to characterize solute dispersion under natural-gradient flow. Only a two-well tracer test with a large well separation in an aquifer with a low degree of heterogeneity can yield a value of {alpha}{sub L} that characterizes natural-gradient tracer spreading. This suggests that a two-well test with a large well separation is the preferred forced-gradient test for characterizing solute dispersion under natural-gradient flow. (24 Refs.)},

Predictive error variance analysis is usually undertaken following calibration using a small number of parameters defined through a priori parsimony. In contrast, we introduce a method for investigating the potential error in predictions made by highly parameterized models calibrated using regularized inversion. Vecchia and Cooley (1987) describe a method of predictive error variance analysis that is constrained by calibration data. We extend this approach to include constraints on parameters that lie within the calibration null space. These constraints are determined by dividing parameter space into combinations of parameters for which estimates can be obtained and those for which they cannot. This enables the contribution to predictive error variance from parameterization simplifications required to solve the inverse problem to be quantified, in addition to the contribution from measurement noise. We also describe a novel technique that restricts the analysis to a strategically defined predictive solution subspace, enabling an approximate predictive error variance analysis to be completed efficiently. The method is illustrated using a synthetic and a real-world groundwater flow and transport model.},

   journal = {Water Resources Research},
   volume = {41},
   number = {10},
   abstract = {[1] A hybrid approach to the regularized inversion of highly parameterized environmental models is described. The method is based on constructing a highly parameterized base model, calculating base parameter sensitivities, and decomposing the base parameter normal matrix into eigenvectors representing principal orthogonal directions in parameter space. The decomposition is used to construct super parameters. Super parameters are factors by which principal eigenvectors of the base parameter normal matrix are multiplied in order to minimize a composite least squares objective function. These eigenvectors define orthogonal axes of a parameter subspace for which information is available from the calibration data. The coordinates of the solution are sought within this subspace. Super parameters are estimated using a regularized nonlinear Gauss-Marquardt-Levenberg scheme. Though super parameters are estimated, Tikhonov regularization constraints are imposed on base parameters. Tikhonov regularization mitigates over fitting and promotes the estimation of reasonable base parameters. Use of a large number of base parameters enables the inversion process to be receptive to the information content of the calibration data, including aspects pertaining to small-scale parameter variations. Because the number of super parameters sustainable by the calibration data may be far less than the number of base parameters used to define the original problem, the computational burden for solution of the inverse problem is reduced. The hybrid methodology is described and applied to a simple synthetic groundwater flow model. It is then applied to a real-world groundwater flow and contaminant transport model. The approach and programs described are applicable to a range of modeling disciplines. Copyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union. (56 Refs.)},

   abstract = {Ground water levels measured in the vicinity of pumping wells are kriged using a regional-linear and point-logarithmic drift, the latter derived from the approximation to the Theis equation for drawdown in response to a pumping well. Kriging is widely used throughout the hydrogeologic discipline, most commonly as the preferred method for constructing gridded hydrogeologic datasets suitable for contouring. Residuals arising from using the most common (linear) drift to krige water levels in the vicinity of extraction wells often indicate large local departures from the linear drift, which correlate with areas of drawdown. The combined regional-linear and point-logarithmic drift accounts for these drawdowns using a logarithmic approximation for the curvature of the potentiometric surface. The drift model approximates the principal physical processes that govern ground water flow and ultimately govern the autocorrelation of ground water elevation data. This approach produces maps of contoured water levels that more realistically represent physical conditions and allow for improved interpretation of measured water-level data by including features and information known to be present. Additional benefits include an improved estimate of the regional (background) hydraulic gradient and generation of an approximately flow-conserved grid suitable for two-dimensional particle tracking.},

Four mineral soils with a range of texture were tested. An empirical relationship between the apparent dielectric constant K{sub a} and the volumetric water content theta {sub v}, which is independent of soil type, soil density, soil temperature, and soluble salt content, can be used to determine theta {sub v}, from air dry to water saturated, with an error of estimate of 0.013. The results of applying the TDR technique on parallel transmission lines in the field to measure theta {sub v} versus depth are encouraging. (24 refs.)},

   abstract = {Four different conceptual models based on alternative geological interpretations were formulated for a shallow 600 km(2) aquifer system in Denmark comprising Quaternary deposits. Each of the four models was calibrated against groundwater heads and discharge measurements through inverse modeling. Subsequently, the transport capabilities of the four models were compared to 32 concentration measurements of environmental tracers (tritium H-3, helium-3 He-3, chlorofluorocarbons CFC11, CFC12 and CFC113). The flow simulations showed only minor differences in spatial head distribution associated with alternative conceptualizations despite the complexity of the aquifer system and the significant differences in geological interpretations. The models, however, showed major differences in predictions of the age of the groundwater and environmental tracer concentrations, differences that are seen as an effect of model structure uncertainty, because no additional calibrations to these data were performed. A single conceptualization may be adequate in characterizing the natural behavior of a field system after calibration, because the calibration procedure is able to compensate for errors in the data or in the conceptual model through biased parameter values. However, once extrapolation beyond the calibration base is attempted, different conceptual model formulations result in significantly different results. Consequently, it is crucial to take model conceptual uncertainty into account when making predictions beyond the calibration base.},

On the basis of tracer concentration histories at 12 multilevel samplers and three extraction wells, some 44 tracer curves in all, significant small-scale variability in permeability is inferred. In general, the permeability is found to decrease as the lower boundary of the aquifer is approached. The permeability trends we find are consistent with tracer swept volume calculations based upon a moment analysis.},

In particular, we find that rapid or high frequency variations in head are primarily sensitive to the specific storage. Conversely, slow or low frequency variations are most strongly influenced by hydraulic conductivity. The nonlinearity of the inverse problem is due to the presence of product terms in which the head field, or its gradient, multiplies a term dependent on flow properties. Thus, in their discrete form, the equations describing the inverse problem are algebraic. The integral formulation provides an alternative approach to linearizing the inverse problem, the Born approximation. We apply the methodology to data from a set of crosswell pressure tests conducted at the Raymond field site. We are able to image two fracture zones within the granitic subsurface. The location of these zones agrees with results from crosswell seismic tomography and borehole logging. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

   abstract = {[ 1] An asymptotic expression for transient head variations, valid at low-frequencies, forms the basis for an efficient scheme for estimating hydraulic conductivity. The critical computational step is equivalent to solving the governing equation for steady state head. Thus, model parameter sensitivities, relating changes in head to changes in hydraulic conductivity, of the fully transient problem can be computed with the equivalent of four steady state head computations. A comparison of model parameter sensitivities computed using the low-frequency asymptotic approach and sensitivities computed using a purely numerical approach indicates good agreement. An inversion of synthetic hydraulic tomography data indicates that it is possible to estimate overall permeability variations using the technique. In an actual application to truncated crosswell pressure tests from the Raymond field site, we image two high permeability fracture zones, in agreement with a conceptual model of the region. The location of the two fracture zones correlates with the position of transmissive fractures, as measured by borehole conductivity logs.},

The second inverse problem is similar to current methods for. interpreting flow data; the transient head amplitudes are related to reservoir storage and conductivity. The first subproblem,,the arrival time inversion, involves much less computation than does amplitude matching. Furthermore, it appears to be more robust with respect to the starting model. Therefore the solution to the arrival time inversion provides a starting model for amplitude matching. The methodology is particularly suited to the analysis of observations from well tests. We apply the approach to observations from two interference tests conducted at the Borehole Test Facility in Oklahoma. Using the transient pressure measurements, we image a shallow conductive fracture. The existence and location of the fracture has been verified by both geophysical and borehole data. In particular, core from a slant well contains an open, vertical fracture which coincides with our conductive feature.},

   volume = {4},

   pages = {389-399},
   abstract = {One of the outstanding challenges in reservoir characterization is to build high-resolution reservoir models that satisfy static as well as dynamic data. However, integration of dynamic data typically requires the solution of an inverse problem that can be computationally intensive and becomes practically infeasible for fine-scale reservoir models. A critical issue here is computation of sensitivity coefficients, the derivatives of dynamic production history with respect to model parameters such as permeability and porosity. We propose a new analytic technique that has several advantages over existing approaches. First, the method utilizes an extremely efficient three-dimensional multiphase streamline simulator as a forward model. Second, the parameter sensitivities are formulated in terms of one-dimensional integrals of analytic functions along the streamlines. Thus, the computation of sensitivities for all model parameters requires only a single simulation run to construct the velocity field and generate the streamlines. The integration of dynamic data is then performed using a two-step iterative inversion that involves (i) "lining up" the breakthrough times at the producing well and then (ii) matching the production history. Our approach follows from an analogy between streamlines and ray tracing in seismology. The inverse method is analogous to seismic waveform inversion and thus, allows us to utilize efficient methods from geophysical imaging. We have applied the proposed approach to a highly heterogeneous carbonate reservoir in west Texas. The reservoir model consists of 50,000 cells and includes multiple patterns with 42 wells. Water-cut histories from 27 producing wells are utilized to characterize porosity and permeability distribution in the reservoir, a total of 100,000 parameters.},

   abstract = {Capture zones of wells play an important role in the protection of groundwater against pollution by persistent chemical compounds. Groundwater flow models can be used to delineate capture zones. As, however, the accuracy and uniqueness of such models may be poor, the outcome of a deterministic modelling exercise is likely to be unreliable. In such a case, stochastic modelling presents an alternative for the delineation of capture zones. In this paper, two methods are compared; the unconditional and conditional Monte-Carlo simulation. In each method, realizations of the aquifer characterized by a combination of recharge rates and transmissivity values are produced. For each realization, the capture zone of the well is determined by particle tracking. By superposition of all capture zones produced, a probability distribution is obtained that describes the probability of a point on the ground surface to belong to the capture zone. This probability is given by the fraction of catchments among all realizations which contain the point. Conditioning the calculation with measured heads usually implies a zoning or spatial resolution of the transmissivity distribution. The need for identification of large scale features for a meaningful zonation is stressed. For a given zoned aquifer, the influence of successively adding measured heads used to condition the stochastics is studied. With an increasing number of conditioning heads, the probability distribution of the capture zone is shown to narrow. This method allows the quantification of the value of measured head data. copyright 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

   abstract = {Interest in producing ethanol from biomass in an attempt to make transportation ecologically sustainable continues to grow. In recent years, a large number of assessments have been conducted to assess the environmental merit of biofuels. Two detailed reviews present contrasting results: one is generally unfavourable, whilst the other is more favourable towards fuel bio-ethanol. However, most work that has been done so far, to assess the conversion of specific feedstocks to biofuels, specifically bio-ethanol, has not gone beyond energy and carbon assessments. This study draws on 47 published assessments that compare bio-ethanol systems to conventional fuel on a life cycle basis, or using life cycle assessment (LCA). A majority of these assessments focused on net energy and greenhouse gases, and despite differing assumptions and system boundaries, the following general lessons emerge: (i) make ethanol from sugar crops, in tropical countries, but approach expansion of agricultural land usage with extreme caution; (ii) consider hydrolysing and fermenting lignocellulosic residues to ethanol; and (iii) the LCA results on grasses as feedstock are insufficient to draw conclusions. It appears that technology choices in process residue handling and in fuel combustion are key, whilst site-specific environmental management tools should best handle biodiversity issues. Seven of the reviewed studies evaluated a wider range of environmental impacts, including resource depletion, global warming, ozone depletion, acidification, eutrophication, human and ecological health, smog formation, etc., but came up with divergent conclusions, possibly due to different approaches in scoping. These LCAs typically report that bio-ethanol results in reductions in resource use and global warming; however, impacts on acidification, human toxicity and ecological toxicity, occurring mainly during the growing and processing of biomass, were more often unfavourable than favourable. It is in this area that further work is needed. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

The methodology couples parameter-estimate and model-prediction uncertainty analyses with optimization to identify the mix of hydrogeologic information (e.g., head, concentration, and/or hydraulic conductivity measurement locations) that will minimize model prediction uncertainty for a given data collection budget. Two alternative optimization algorithms are presented and compared: a branch-and-bound algorithm and a genetic algorithm. A series of synthetic examples are presented to demonstrate the adaptability of the methodology to different sampling scenarios. The examples reveal two important properties of this network design problem. First, model-parameter and model-prediction uncertainty analyses are important components of the network design methodology because they provide a natural framework for evaluating the cost/information trade-off for different types of data and different sampling network designs. Second, the genetic algorithm can identify near-optimal solutions for a small fraction of the computational effort needed to determine the globally optimal solutions of the branch-and-bound algorithm.},

   abstract = {As part of ongoing research conducted at one of the U.S. Geological Survey's Water, Energy, and Biogeochemical Budgets sites, work was undertaken to describe the spatial and temporal variability of stream and ground water isotopic composition and cation chemistry in the Trout Lake watershed, to relate the variability to the watershed flow system, and to identify the linkages of geochemical evolution and source of water in the watershed. The results are based on periodic sampling of sites at two scales along Allequash Creek, a small headwater stream in northern Wisconsin. Based on this sampling, there are distinct water isotopic and geochemical differences observed at a smaller hillslope scale and the larger Allequash Creek scale. The variability was larger than expected for this simple watershed, and is likely to be seen in more complex basins. Based on evidence from multiple isotopes and stream chemistry, the flow system arises from three main source waters (terrestrial-, lake-, or wetland-derived recharge) that can be identified along any flowpath using water isotopes together with geochemical characteristics such as iron concentrations. The ground water chemistry demonstrates considerable spatial variability that depends mainly on the flowpath length and water mobility through the aquifer. Calcium concentrations increase with increasing flowpath length, whereas strontium isotope ratios increase with increasing extent of stagnation in either the unsaturated or saturated zones as waters move from source to sink. The flowpath distribution we identify provides important constraints on the calibration of ground water flow models such as that undertaken by Pint et al. (this issue).},

   abstract = {Finite element models are presented in this paper to study the kinematics and dynamics of the North American plate. The plate is represented by a portion of thin spherical shell modeled with Newtonian fluid. The external actions acting at the plate boundary as well as on the plate bottom are expressed by a set of undetermined parameters in terms of the results of the Nuvel-1 model. The plate viscosity is considered as regionally uniform. Constrained by the observed data of principal stress orientation and VLBI velocity, the tectonic deformations and stresses in the North American plate as well as the driving forces are jointly inverted. By the method of least squares and the principle of linear superposition, the inversion is posed as a standard nonlinear optimization problem, which is solved numerically by the genetic algorithms combined with a kind of quasi-Newtonian method. The computed results show that some of our simple dynamic models can well and consistently fit the observed kinematic and dynamic data, even though the data have very different time scales. The data fitting indicates that continental lithosphere is an order of magnitude more viscous than oceanic lithosphere which, in turn, is an order of magnitude more viscous than lithosphere in plate boundaries, including the diffuse plate boundary in the western United States. In the middle part of the plate, the predicted tectonic stresses are uniform both in orientation and magnitude, with a typical regime of strike-slip type. The modeling results suggest that the plate motion is driven by forces acting along the Atlantic and Arctic ridges, the South American boundary, the Caribbean boundary and the San Andreas fault, while resisted by forces acting along the other boundary segments and by the viscous drag forces at the base of the plate.},

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) established the research center on the DOE Oak Ridge Reservation in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to conduct in situ field-scale studies on bioremediation of metals and radionuclides. Bioremediation studies are being conducted on the saprolite, shale bedrock, and ground water at the site that have been contaminated with nitrate, uranium, technetium, tetrachloroethylene, and other contaminants (U.S. DOE 1997). Geophysical methods were effective in imaging the high-ionic strength plume and in defining the transition zone between saprolite and bedrock zones that appears to have a significant influence on contaminant transport. The geophysical data were used to help select the location and depth of investigation for field research plots. Drilling, borehole geophysics, and ground water sampling were used to verify the surface geophysical studies.},

   pages = {W01416},
   abstract = {fractures dominate chemical migration in many fractured aquifers, recent studies suggest that the pervasive 'small-scale' fracturing once considered of less significance can be equally important for characterizing the spatial extent and residence time associated with transport processes. A detailed examination of chemical migration through fracture-controlled aquifers is used to advance this conceptual understanding. The influence of fracture structure is evaluated by quantifying the effects to transport caused by a systematic removal of fractures from three-dimensional discrete fracture models whose attributes are derived from geologic and hydrologic conditions at multiple field sites. Results indicate that the effects to transport caused by network simplification are sensitive to the fracture network characteristics, degree of network simplification, and plume travel distance, but primarily in an indirect sense since correlation to individual attributes is limited. Transport processes can be 'enhanced' or 'restricted' from network simplification meaning that the elimination of fractures may increase or decrease mass migration, mean travel time, dispersion, and tailing of the concentration plume. The results demonstrate why, for instance, chemical migration may not follow the classic advection-dispersion equation where dispersion approximates the effect of the ignored geologic structure as a strictly additive process to the mean flow. The analyses further reveal that the prediction error caused by fracture network simplification is reduced by at least 50% using the median estimate from an ensemble of simplified fracture network models, and that the error from network simplification is at least 70% less than the stochastic variability from multiple realizations.},

The travel time probability density function observed for Br and Cl during unsteady flow in an unsaturated, well structured clay suggested a two-component mechanism comprising fast solute transport through large, interped voids and slow to negligible transport through small, intraped voids. The modal and median travel times varied with soil type, initial water content and rate of water input. The fractional volume of water that participated in solute transport, theta {sub st}, was calculated from the rate of water input and the median solute travel time. Values of theta {sub st} ranged from 14% to nearly 90% of the mean volumetric water contents ( theta ) of the soils. (16 refs.)},

The method of interactive evolutionary computation provides for the inclusion of qualitative geological expertise within a rigorous mathematical inversion scheme, by simply asking an expert user to evaluate a sequence of forward geological models. The traditional numerical misfit is replaced by a human appraisal of misfit. We use this interactive technique to successfully invert a geodynamic model for a conceptual pattern of fault spacing during crustal extension.},

   abstract = {Cross-borehole flowmeter pulse tests define subsurface connections between discrete fractures using short stress periods to monitor the propagation of the pulse through the flow system. This technique is an improvement over other cross-borehole techniques because measurements can be made in open boreholes without packers or previous identification of water-producing intervals. The method is based on the concept of monitoring the propagation of pulses rather than steady flow through the fracture network. In this method, a hydraulic stress is applied to a borehole connected to a single, permeable fracture, and the distribution of flow induced by that stress monitored in adjacent boreholes. The transient flow responses are compared to type curves computed for several different types of fracture connections. The shape of the transient flow response indicates the type of fracture connection, and the fit of the data to the type curve yields an estimate of its transmissivity and storage coefficient. The flowmeter pulse test technique was applied in fractured shale at a volatile-organic contaminant plume in Watervliet, New York. Flowmeter and other geophysical logs were used to identify permeable fractures in eight boreholes in and near the contaminant plume using single-borehole flow measurements. Flowmeter cross-hole pulse tests were used to identify connections between fractures detected in the boreholes. The results indicated a permeable fracture network connecting many of the individual boreholes, and demonstrated the presence of an ambient upward hydraulic-head gradient throughout the site.},

This paper examines sample-size calculation for both independent groups and matched-pairs trials for log-transformed outcomes. For both types of trial, we demonstrate how the calculation can be formulated in terms of a relative treatment effect and a statement of relative variability, both specified on the original scale of measurement. For a comparison of two independent groups, the relative treatment effect is the ratio of group geometric means (or alternatively, group arithmetic means) and the coefficient of variation is used as a summary of relative variability. For a matched-pairs comparison, the appropriate relative treatment effect is the geometric mean of the within-pair ratios, and relative variability can be specified as an upper bound on within-pair ratios under a null hypothesis of the relative effect being equal to 1 (i.e., no difference). We discuss the clinical study that motivated this work and demonstrate the application of the sample-size calculation to this study. Control Clin Trials 1999;20:547-554},

   abstract = {The pioneering work of Jaynes in Bayesian/maximum entropy methods has been successfully explored in many disciplines. The principle of maximum entropy (PME) is a powerful and versatile tool of inferring a probability distribution from constraints that do not completely characterize that distribution. Minimum relative entropy (MRE) is a method which has all the important attributes of the maximum entropy approach with the advantage that prior information may be easily included. In this paper we use MRE to determine the prior probability density function (pdf) of a set of model parameters based on limited information. The resulting pdf is used in Monte Carlo simulations to provide expected values in field variables such as concentration, and confidence limits. We compare the probabilistic results from a traditional advection-dispersion (ADE) model based on volumetric averaging concepts with that of a model based on the assumption that the hydraulic conductivity is a stationary stochastic process. The results suggest that although Naff's (1990) model satisfies the observed data to a better degree than ADE model, the upper and lower confidence bands about the mean value are larger than the ADE results. This result we attribute to the fact that Naff's (1990) model simply contains more parameters, each of which is unknown and has to be estimated. There is no statistical difference between the expected values of second-spatial moments for the two models. The examples presented in this paper illustrate problems associated with assigning Gaussian pdfs as priors in a probabilistic model. First, such an assumption for the input parameters actually injects more information into the problem than may actually exist, whether consciously or unconsciously. This fact is borne out by comparison with minimum relative entropy theory. Second, the output parameters as suggested from the Monte Carlo analysis cannot be assumed to be Gaussian distributed even when the prior pdf is Gaussian in form. In a practical setting, the significance of this result and the approximation of Gaussian form would depend on the toxicity and environmental standards that apply to the problem.},

   abstract = {In this paper we show that given prior information in terms of a lower and upper bound, a prior bias, and constraints in terms of measured data, minimum relative entropy (MRE) yields exact expressions for the posterior probability density function (pdf) and the expected value of the linear inverse problem. In addition, we are able to produce any desired confidence intervals. In numerical simulations, we use the MRE approach to recover the release and evolution histories of plume in a one-dimensional, constant known velocity and dispersivity system. For noise-free data, we find that the reconstructed plume evolution history is indistinguishable from the true history. An exact match to the observed data is evident. Two methods are chosen for dissociating signal from a noisy data set. The first uses a modification of MRE for uncertain data. The second method uses ''presmoothing'' by fast Fourier transforms and Butterworth filters to attempt to remove noise from the signal before the ''noise-free'' variant of MRE inversion is used. Both methods appear to work very well in recovering the true signal, and qualitatively appear superior to that of Skaggs and Kabala [1994]. We also solve for a degenerate case with a very high standard deviation in the noise. The recovered model indicates that the MRE inverse method did manage to recover the salient features of the source history. Once the plume source history has been developed, future behavior of a plume can then be cast in a probabilistic framework. For an example simulation, the MRE approach not only was able to resolve the source function from noisy data but also was able to correctly predict future behavior.},

The facility is adjacent to the former S-3 Ponds which received trillions of liters of acidic plating wastes. High levels of uranium are present, with up to 800 mg kg{sup -1} in the soil and 84-210 {mu}M in the groundwater. Ambient groundwater has a highly buffered pH of [similar to]3.4 and high levels of aluminum (12-13 mM), calcium (22-25 mM), and nitrate (80-160 mM). Adjusting the pH of groundwater to [similar to]5 within the aquifer would deposit extensive aluminum hydroxide precipitate. Calcium is present in the groundwater at levels that inhibit U(VI) reduction, but its removal by injection of a high pH solution would generate clogging precipitate. Nitrate also inhibits U(VI) reduction and is present at such high concentrations that its removal by in situ denitrification would generate large amounts of N{sub 2} gas and biomass. To establish and maintain hydraulic control, we installed a four well recirculation system parallel to geologic strike, with an inner loop nested within an outer loop. For monitoring, we drilled three boreholes perpendicular to strike across the inner loop and installed multilevel sampling tubes within them. A tracer pulse with clean water established travel times and connectivity between wells and enabled the assessment of contaminant release from the soil matrix. Subsequently, a highly conductive region of the subsurface was prepared for biostimulation by removing clogging agents and inhibitors and increasing pH. For 2 months, groundwater was pumped from the hydraulically conductive zone; treated to remove aluminum, calcium, and nitrate, and supplemented with tap water; adjusted to pH 4.3-4.5; then returned to the hydraulically conductive zone. This protocol removed most of the aqueous aluminum and calcium. The pH of the injected treated water was then increased to 6.0-6.3. With additional flushing, the pH of the extracted water gradually increased to 5.5-6.0, and nitrate concentrations fell to 0.5-1.0 mM. These conditions were judged suitable for biostimulation. In a companion paper (Wu et al., Environ. Sci. Technol. 2006, 40, 3978-3987), we describe the effects of ethanol addition on in situ denitrification and U(VI) reduction and immobilization.

After establishing conditions favorable for bioremediation (Wu, et al. Environ. Sci. Technol. 2006, 40, 3988-3995), intermittent additions of ethanol were initiated within the conditioned inner loop of a nested well recirculation system. These additions initially stimulated denitrification of matrix-entrapped nitrate, but after 2 months, aqueous U levels fell from 5 to [similar to]1 {mu}M and sulfate reduction ensued. Continued additions sustained U(VI) reduction over 13 months. X-ray near-edge absorption spectroscopy (XANES) confirmed U(VI) reduction to U(IV) within the inner loop wells, with up to 51%, 35%, and 28% solid-phase U(IV) in sediment samples from the injection well, a monitoring well, and the extraction well, respectively. Microbial analyses confirmed the presence of denitrifying, sulfate-reducing, and iron-reducing bacteria in groundwater and sediments. System pH was generally maintained at less than 6.2 with low bicarbonate level (0.75-1.5 mM) and residual sulfate to suppress methanogenesis and minimize uranium mobilization. The bioavailability of sorbed U(VI) was manipulated by addition of low-level carbonate ( <5 mM)followed by ethanol (1-1.5 mM). Addition of low levels of carbonate increased the concentration of aqueous U, indicating an increased rate of U desorption due to formation of uranyl carbonate complexes. Upon ethanol addition, aqueous U(VI) levels fell, indicating that the rate of microbial reduction exceeded the rate of desorption. Sulfate levels simultaneously decreased, with a corresponding increase in sulfide. When ethanol addition ended but carbonate addition continued, soluble U levels increased, indicating faster desorption than reduction. When bicarbonate addition stopped, aqueous U levels decreased, indicating adsorption to sediments. Changes in the sequence of carbonate and ethanol addition confirmed that carbonate-controlled desorption increased bioavailability of U(VI) for reduction. CP 2006 American Chemical Society.

   abstract = {We propose a generalized travel-time inversion method for production data integration into reservoir models using finite-difference-based reservoir simulators. Our approach is motivated by seismic waveform imaging and is particularly well-suited for large-scale field applications because the computation cost depends only on the number of wells regardless of the number of parameters or the amount of observed data. Instead of matching the production data directly, we minimize a "travel-time shift" at each well derived by maximizing the cross-correlation between the observed and calculated production response. An optimal control method is used to compute the sensitivity of the travel time with respect to reservoir parameters. Finally, data integration is carried out via a modified Gauss-Newton method. There are several advantages associated with the proposed travel-time inversion method. First, it is robust and computationally efficient. The travel-time misfit function is quasilinear with respect to changes in reservoir properties. As a result, the minimization proceeds rapidly even if the prior model is not close to the solution. Second, the computational cost associated with the sensitivity computation depends only on the number of wells, which can be orders of magnitude lower than the number of parameters or the amount of observed data. This offers a tremendous advantage over the commonly used gradient simulator method or the conventional adjoint methods that attempt to minimize the production data directly. Furthermore, the travel time approach also offers computational advantage during minimization of the misfit function using the Gauss-Newton algorithm. We have presented several examples to demonstrate the power, generality, and practical feasibility of our proposed approach for large-scale field applications.},

   abstract = {A new technology, hydraulic/partitioning tracer tomography (HPTT), is proposed to survey spatial distributions of hydraulic properties and dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) in the subsurface. HPTT is nothing more than a set of multiple hydraulic/partitioning tracer tests and synthesis of all the tests to map the spatial distributions. It involves injection of water at one borehole in a source zone to create a steady state forced gradient flow field, then release of conservative/partitioning tracers at the same borehole, and monitoring heads and tracer breakthroughs at the others. The same operation is repeated using different boreholes for the water and the tracer injections. To analyze the head and tracer data obtained from the proposed tomographic survey, a joint stochastic estimator was developed. Numerical experiments were then conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of HPTT as well as the stochastic estimator. Results show that prior knowledge of hydraulic heterogeneity is critical for mapping the distribution of DNAPLs. In addition, the results suggest that the proposed HPTT in conjunction with the stochastic estimator is potentially a viable tool for high-resolution characterization of subsurface heterogeneity and contamination.},

The multiple cell balance method is used to solve the nonlinear governing equations as well as their adjoint equations. Algorithms are developed for calculating sensitivity coefficients of heads in each layer of an aquifer with respect to various parameters. A concept called 'contribution of an observation' is introduced which can be used to measure the usefulness of an observation in connection with data requirements for parameter identification. It links experimental design with observation errors and the requirement of model application. The sufficiency of an observation system for parameter identification can be evaluated at the design stage before extensive resources are committed to data collection. A numerical example is given.

   abstract = {The determination of the optimal type, location, and trajectory of a nonconventional well is extremely challenging. The problem is more complicated than other well optimization problems because of the wide variety of possible well types (i.e., number, location, and orientation of laterals) that must be considered. In this paper, a general methodology for the optimization of nonconventional wells is presented. The optimization procedure entails a Genetic Algorithm (GA) applied in conjunction with several acceleration routines that include an artificial neural network, a hill climber, and a near-well upscaling technique. The overall methodology is then applied to a number of problems involving different reservoir types and fluid systems. It is shown that the objective function (cumulative oil produced or net present value of the project) is always increased relative to its value in the first generation of the optimization, in some cases by 30% or more. The optimal well type is found to vary depending on the reservoir model and objective function. The effects of reservoir uncertainty are also included in some of the optimizations. It is shown that the optimal type of well can differ, depending on whether single or multiple realizations of the reservoir geology are considered.},

The interdependence between the tanks is described by exponential functions of the model's parameters. The parameters are identified using the Simplex method. In comparison to traditional unit hydrograph (TUH) methods, the proposed UH method has the following advantages: (1) it can be used to separate quick and slow streamflow components; (2) it is appropriate for forecasting streamflow hydrographs produced by various storms such as single-peak storms and multi-peak storms without resorting to changing model's parameters; and (3) it does not require either an a priori calculation of rainfall excess or baseflow separation for deriving the UH. The TUH models such as the Sherman model and the Nash model with three cascade reservoirs are particular cases of the proposed model. The applicability and validity of the proposed model are verified using observed rainfall-streamflow data from an actual basin. The resulting computed streamflows show a good correspondence with observed ones. (26 Refs.)},

Two different irregular mesh interpolation methods, linear and natural neighbor, are evaluated. A synthetic test shows that the adaptive mesh seismic tomography method recovers the true synthetic model well in both the linear and natural neighbor interpolation cases. Use of more accurate differential data is helpful in removing artifacts in the model that result from the noisier absolute data. Application of the adaptive mesh scheme to Parkfield, California, results in much more uniform sampling of the model (as measured by the derivative weight sum) on the optimized irregular inversion mesh compared to a regular grid. The across-strike cross sections resulting from using either just the absolute data or both the absolute and differential data show a clear velocity contrast at the San Andreas fault in the linear and natural neighbor interpolation cases. The velocity model obtained using natural neighbor interpolation is smoother than that from linear interpolation. Including the differential data in the inversion yields more clustered event locations and removes a velocity reversal to the southwest of the fault, which is likely caused by noise in the absolute data.},

   abstract = {[1] Hydraulic tomography is a cost-effective technique for characterizing the heterogeneity of hydraulic parameters in the subsurface. During hydraulic tomography surveys a large number of hydraulic heads (i.e., aquifer responses) are collected from a series of pumping or injection tests in an aquifer. These responses are then used to interpret the spatial distribution of hydraulic parameters of the aquifer using inverse modeling. In this study, we developed an efficient sequential successive linear estimator (SSLE) for interpreting data from transient hydraulic tomography to estimate three-dimensional hydraulic conductivity and specific storage fields of aquifers. We first explored this estimator for transient hydraulic tomography in a hypothetical one-dimensional aquifer. Results show that during a pumping test, transient heads are highly correlated with specific storage at early time but with hydraulic conductivity at late time. Therefore reliable estimates of both hydraulic conductivity and specific storage must exploit the head data at both early and late times. Our study also shows that the transient heads are highly correlated over time, implying only infrequent head measurements are needed during the estimation. Applying this sampling strategy to a well-posed problem, we show that our SSLE can produce accurate estimates of both hydraulic conductivity and specific storage fields. The benefit of hydraulic tomography for ill-posed problems is then demonstrated. Finally, to affirm the robustness of our SSLE approach, we apply the SSLE approach to a hypothetical three-dimensional heterogeneous aquifer.},

   abstract = {[1] Transient hydraulic tomography (THT) is a potentially cost-effective and high-resolution technique for mapping spatial distributions of the hydraulic conductivity and specific storage in aquifers. Interpretation of abundant well hydrographs of a THT survey, however, is a computational challenge. We take on this challenge by developing an estimation approach that utilizes the zeroth and first temporal moments of well hydrographs, instead of drawdown itself. The governing equations for the temporal moments are Poisson's equations. These equations demand less computational resources as opposed to the parabolic equation that governs drawdown evolution. Likewise, the adjoint equations for evaluating sensitivities of the moments for parameter estimation also take the same forms. Therefore a temporal moment approach is expected to expedite the interpretation of THT surveys. On the basis of this premise we extend our sequential successive linear estimator to use the zeroth moment and characteristic time of the drawdown-recovery data generated by THT surveys. We subsequently investigate computational efficiency and accuracy of the moment approach. Results of the investigation show that the temporal moment approach yields results similar to those from the approach that uses transient heads but at significantly less computational costs. Limitations using temporal moments are discussed subsequently.},

   abstract = {Recent numerical studies have demonstrated that the conventional interpretation of the borehole flowmeter test (BFT) may lead to considerable errors in estimates of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity (K-r) due to neglect of head loss across the electromagnetic borehole flowmeter (EBF). Even in uniform aquifers, the conventional interpretation underestimates K-r at the base and overestimates K-r at the top of the aquifer. In this paper, we derive exact analytical solutions for hydraulic head and streamlines induced by the BFT in a confined homogeneous aquifer. The solutions explicitly consider head loss across the EBF. The derived analytical solutions for head distribution in the vicinity of the pumping well and for volumetric flux to the well sections above and below the EBF can be used to interpret field BFT data. In uniform aquifers, this approach can be applied to obtain estimates of K-r from the conventional interpretation. Applications of this approach to the BFT field data set from a highly heterogeneous aquifer indicate that the constraint of aquifer homogeneity limits the applicability of this approach, but it can provide useful insights into the mechanism of flux redistribution near the borehole during the BFT.
